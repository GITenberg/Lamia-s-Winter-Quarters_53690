<p>‘I observe,’ said Lamia, ‘that another of those
somewhat numerous prose performances of yours,
that are more or less remotely connected with
Gardens, and which you were pleased, without
any previous consultation with me, to entitle
<cite>Lamia’s Winter-Quarters</cite>, is, like the first of the
series, <cite>The Garden That I Love</cite>, to be issued in an
equally luxurious form, and to be illustrated by
the attractive talent of Mr. Elgood. But since this
project, to which my attention was called by that
now universal source of information, advertise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>ments,
has been alluded to, do you mind telling
me why you called our delightful sojourn in a
Tuscan villa overlooking Florence my winter-quarters
rather than the Poet’s winter-quarters,
or Veronica’s, or, for that matter, even yours?‘</p>

<p>Somewhat embarrassed, I replied:</p>

<p>‘To have called the book my winter-quarters
would have savoured of egotism, and would,
moreover, I fear, have failed in attractiveness.’</p>

<p>‘But against Veronica’s name, or the Poet’s,
no such objection would lie?‘</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not,’ I said. ‘But possibly from
living with them, to say nothing of you, I have
acquired a habit of respect for the fact; and it
was more consonant with truth to call the winter-quarters
yours.’</p>

<p>‘How is that?’ she asked.</p>

<p>‘Well, you see, Veronica does what the Poet
wishes, and the Poet does what you wish, and
so——’</p>

<p>‘I beg to say,’ she interrupted, ‘<em>that</em> is not
the fact. <em>I</em> do what the <em>Poet</em> wishes.’</p>

<p>‘Is not that much the same thing?’ I
replied. ‘You always seem to have the same
wish about everything. So I suppose you felt
precisely as he did when he wrote those adulatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
lines which I saw in the public prints, a few
days ago, under the heading, “A Poetical Impromptu.”‘</p>

<p>‘Really! He wrote no such, nor indeed any,
lines, never having seen nor heard of the lady
in question, in his life.’</p>

<p>‘Is it possible?‘
‘Everything of that kind is possible in these
days.’</p>

<p>‘But did he not contradict it?‘
‘Did he contradict! Like a good many other
men, he would have to keep a Secretary for no
other purpose than to contradict what is reported
in the papers, and most of which they probably
never see. I should think he turned the opportunity
to better account by recalling a couplet of
Pope—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Let Dennis charge all Grub Street on my quill,</div>
  <div class="verse">I wished the man a dinner, and sate still.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘But,’ I said, ‘are not such inventions calculated
to injure the influence of the prints that
resort to them?’</p>

<p>‘I should think so,’ she said, honouring me
for once by talking seriously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span> ‘But whose, and
what, influence is not being injured just now by
their own misdoings? The House of Commons,
for instance, though more written and talked
about than ever, has long been losing influence,
and the Press is now following suit; and it is
the silent, or comparatively silent, persons and
forces that are acquiring or increasing influence;
the Monarchy, the House of Lords, and——’</p>

<p>‘The House of Lords!’ I exclaimed. ‘I
thought it was going to be abolished, or to have
its very moderate claims yet further curtailed.’</p>

<p>‘Did you?’ she answered. ‘Then your
thoughts are not of much value. I daresay
it would be difficult to persuade Politicians that
Shakespeare was wiser than all the sons of the
Mother of Parliaments put together; and what
does he say?</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Take but degree away, untune that string,</div>
  <div class="verse">And mark what discord follows.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
</div></div></div>

<p>And so long as the British nation continues on
the whole to be sane, it will never consent to
take “degree” away, in order to fasten on itself
a dead level and a tyrannical uniformity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>.‘</p>

<p>I was so flattered by Lamia having, in a
short space of time, condescended to talk seriously
with me, that I thought a favourable opportunity
had arisen for preferring any request that
I wanted her to grant. Encouraged by this
feeling, I ventured to say:</p>

<p>‘A great adornment and advantage to the
forthcoming volume would be a portrait of the
person whose name is associated with it; in other
words, a portrait of Lamia.’</p>

<p>‘So it has come to that!’ she replied. ‘Not
satisfied with having travestied me in—let me
see—yes, one, two, three, four, five successive
volumes, <cite>The Garden That I Love</cite>, <cite>In Veronica’s
Garden</cite>, <cite>Lamia’s Winter-Quarters</cite>, <cite>Haunts of
Ancient Peace</cite>, and <cite>The Poet’s Diary</cite>, you now propose
to vulgarise my ideal loveliness and magnetic
personality in order to gratify the curiosity of a
number of persons who have never seen me, and
never will. Let me never hear of such a proposal
again. As the little boy said, “Myself is my
own”; and, if it please you, part of</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent22">‘...the gleam,</div>
  <div class="verse">The light that never was on sea or land,</div>
  <div class="verse">The consecration, and the Poet’s dream.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Your wish is my law,’ I hastened to say, and
was about to snatch at the first subject I could
think of to ward off further reproof, when she
held out a little posy of Penzance sweet-briar
roses she had been wearing, saying in her sweetest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
manner, as though afraid she might have wounded
me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span> ‘Are they not lovely? No, keep them, if
you care to do so. They remind me of something
I saw the other day, when, on my way to
London for a few hours, the train halted between
Waterloo Station and Charing Cross at a point
overlooking a number of back plots and alleys
of the humblest description; and the one immediately
below me arrested my gaze. There
were two short rows of the purest white linen,
lately out of the wash-tub, hanging out to dry;
and under them, a hammock, with a chubby baby
in it, fast asleep. A few feet behind was a red-brick
wall, and along its foot three rows of pelargoniums
in full flower, and evidently most carefully
hoed and watered. A comely looking woman, with
her sleeves tucked up as far as they would go,
came out of the house, peeped into the hammock,
kissed, or rather hugged the baby, and then turned
it round to screen it a little from the direct rays
of the sun that were shining on this little paradise.
Then the train moved on; and I thought to
myself, with a feeling of quiet joy, that neither
the garden that we love, nor the Tuscan garden
that was our winter-quarters, nor all the gardens
and palaces in the world, contain more happiness
than those few yards of ground in one of the
humblest parts of London, tenanted by linen
hung out to dry, three rows of pelargoniums,
a hammock with a sleeping child in it, and a
loving mother.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I had seen it,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘I described it to the Poet,’ Lamia replied;
‘and he then did indulge in an Impromptu,
which—let me think a moment—yes—ran somewhat
like this:</p>

  <div class="verse">‘How blest are they who hunger not</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">For riches or renown,</div>

</div><div class="stanza">

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="I"></a>LAMIA’S WINTER-QUARTERS</h2>


<p>‘Where is Lamia?’</p>

<p>The inquiry is one not infrequently made;
for, while most of us can vanish without being
missed, some favoured individuals there are whose
disappearance at once excites a sense of loss; and
Lamia is one of these. The question, I need
scarcely say, was put by Veronica; since the Poet
maintains a fine irresponsible attitude respecting
others as well as about himself, and, however
anxious I may be to keep sight of Lamia, I
am hardly so simple as to betray my desire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
But, responding with sincere alacrity to Veronica’s
question, I protested I had not the faintest notion
where she was, but would at once go in search
of her.</p>

<p>Veronica’s solicitude was, I suspect, prompted
by that deep-seated regard for decorous behaviour,
which, far from leaving it at home, she had
carefully brought abroad as peculiarly applicable
to foreign parts and Continental manners. She is
well aware that, in the matter of social observances,
Lamia is capable of almost any enormity; and
her absence from the morning-room of the hotel
in the southern seaport where we were making
our first halt, inspired her with natural misgiving.</p>

<p>The search, as it turned out, was not a long
one. Lamia I found seated under a tall white-flowering
magnolia in a leafy garden hard by,
where oleanders already well set for bloom, though
still far from their flowering season, and trees that
for some unknown reason English people call
mimosas, but which they should learn to speak of
as acacias, and various evergreen shrubs of stately
stature, concerning which I should not at present
like to be too closely cross-questioned, offered a
sufficient protection against the burning December
morning sun, while permitting occasional glimpses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
of deep-blue sky. Ostensibly, she was having a
further polish put on her brown leather shoes by a
black-eyed, black-haired, tawny-skinned urchin, who
entered into her humour with true Southern adaptability,
and who would have gone on performing
his quite unnecessary office as long as ever the
young lady desired. For the moment, I think,
she had forgotten all about him, for she had three
oranges in her lap,—‘One for each of you,’ she
said,—and was delicately dividing the other for
her own delectation. A large spray of Parma
violets, fastened to her attractive person, I need
scarcely say exactly where they should be, completed
her recent purchases.</p>

<p>‘Do you mind asking Veronica to come and
see me?’ she said, ‘for I never was so happy in
my life.’</p>

<p>I bethought me of the somewhat stern interrogatory,
‘Where is Lamia?’ and merely observed
that Veronica was superintending the final operations
of the maid in the matter of repacking, and
probably would wish not to be disturbed.</p>

<p>‘How strange!’ said Lamia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span> ‘and how tastes
differ! The smell of canvas covers and leather
straps is particularly disagreeable to me; whereas
the island of Zante itself could not be more
fragrant than the scent of these violets and oranges,
to say nothing of the magnolia flowers overhead,
and that delightful son of the sunshine at my feet.
And to think that, say thirty-six hours ago, I
roused you and the Poet from your slumbers to
look upon a snow-white world! I daresay you
will think me very capricious, but <em>this</em> is the
garden that I love.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="fr">Les absens ont toujours tort</i>,’ said the Poet,
emerging from a shady avenue behind her. At
the sound of his voice she rose somewhat hastily,
as though a performance quite good enough for
me was scarcely consonant with the half-courtly
veneration she entertains for him; gave the
oranges in her lap and a franc-piece to the smiling
young urchin, who thought her more fascinating
than ever, and said reproachfully, ‘Then why do
<em>you</em> absent yourself?’</p>

<p>‘That was hardly what I meaned,’ he replied.
‘I was referring rather to the position of inferiority
you assign to the garden that we love, because it is
now far away from us. But you are quite right,
and are going to Italy in the proper spirit.
Whatever you see there, admire consumedly, and
you cannot be far wrong.’</p>

<p>‘Are we not in Italy already?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>‘
‘Almost. Its vestibule is Provence.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I suppose it is because we are very simple folk,
and lead at home a rather primitive life, that we
find everything new which most other people
find familiar, and so many things attractive that
the bulk of the world treat as undeserving of
attention. Along that magical coast, where we
turned our gaze first to the sea-fringe, then to
the hill declivities, then back again to the white-laced
bays, and never being able to determine
which were the more beautiful, I observe that
persons who have travelled many hundreds of
miles in order to enjoy the sunshine and glamour
of the South, are well content to make this entrancing
journey in a railway carriage, pulling
down the blinds if the sun be a trifle too hot,
and conning their newspaper or turning over the
leaves of some conventional novel, in any case.
That was not our way of travelling, which was a
good deal more leisurely and more old-fashioned.
We should have liked to find ourselves behind
Veronica’s ponies, but our hired vehicle did well
enough; and, while we never asked our cheerfully
communicative driver to quicken his pace, we
frequently begged him to slacken it, and over and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
over again bade him halt altogether. Although,
save to Lamia, the road was no new one, we all
alike had fresh unsophisticated eyes for it, and all
of us found it a veritable wonder-world. Indeed,
I could not help reflecting that we behaved very
much as we behave at home in the garden that we
love, declaring that the last blue creek, or the last
secular olive-grove, was the most wonderful we
had yet seen, for no better reason than that it <em>was</em>
the last.</p>

<p>‘And they told me,’ said Lamia, ‘that the
scenery is so monotonous, and that bay follows
bay, and mountain repeats mountain, with provoking
uniformity. Why, there are not any
two alike. I only wish human beings were as
diverse.’</p>

<p>‘It all depends,’ said the Poet, ‘whether you
look lovingly or unlovingly, passionately or dispassionately.
One must be intoxicated by scenery,
in order to appreciate it. Tranquil survey is not
enough, and scrutinising curiosity is fatal.’</p>

<p>‘I am sure,’ said Lamia, ‘Veronica is not
intoxicated. She is tranquillity itself.’</p>

<p>‘Veronica, you mean,’ was his reply,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span> ‘does not
effervesce. But her silence is, perhaps, the measure
of her emotion.’</p>

<p>‘O stop! stop! I <em>must</em> have some of those
anemones.‘
How often a kindred need of this kind arose
on the part of Lamia, it would be hard to say; but,
by degrees, every part of the carriage that was not
occupied by ourselves was filled with tulips, windflowers,
roses, and long branches of early-flowering
golden acacia.</p>

<p>‘You baby!’ said Veronica, ‘what are you
going to do with them all?’</p>

<p>‘You shall see, when luncheon-hour has
arrived.‘
‘Which I think it now has,’ I ventured to
suggest.</p>

<p>Thereupon we came to a standstill; the driver
took bit and bridle off his willing little nags, and
replaced them with well-filled nose-bags, while we
unloaded our hampers, that were as commodiously
as they were generously stocked. The unpacking
of them went on under the skilful direction of
Veronica, who would no more have dreamed of
allowing us to lunch <i lang="it">al fresco</i> without spotless
table-cloth, neat napkins, and all the apparatus of
civilisation, than in her parlour at home. But she
allowed Lamia to select the spot; and the choice,
though made from romantic rather than from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
practical impulse, proved to be not wanting in
comfort. Under a carob-tree, the first Lamia
had ever seen, the cloth was spread; and then
she scattered rather than arranged her lately
gathered flowers, with infinite taste. A short
distance away, as we looked under the olive-trees
across the ruddy clods and accidental wild-flowers,
were the innumerable dimples of the amiable sea;
and, did we turn our heads, slopes of terraced
fertility mounted gradually toward deciduous
clusters of woodland, and peaks of more accentuated
pine.</p>

<p>‘Will it be very unromantic,’ asked Lamia,
‘to seem hungry? Because if it would, as I
should not like to hurt any one’s feelings, I can
sate the edge of appetite with bare imagination of
a feast, or, at most, with the unsubstantial pageant
of a mandarin orange.‘
Veronica’s reply was to cut some solid slices of
galantine of fowl, and to tell me to do the same
to one of those long rolls of crisp crust which
contrast so favourably with the semi-barbarous
baker’s bread of our own beloved island. The
Poet, as of right, withdrew the tow from the
withy-bound flask of ruby wine, saying to me, and
to me only, as he did so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span> ‘<i lang="la">Siccis omnia nam dura
deus proposuit</i>.’ It was our first open-air meal
under the southern sky; and even Veronica, who,
as we all know, is rather on the side of indoor
festivity at home, could not protest that, in the
shelter Lamia had chosen for us, it was a touch
too cold for the pleasant and perfectly safe satisfaction
of our appetite.</p>

<p>‘Is it always like this?’ asked Lamia.</p>

<p>‘Far from it,’ I was going to reply; but the
Poet anticipated me.</p>

<p>‘Yes, always, Lamia! always, always, always!
No one deserves to travel who anticipates anything
less agreeable than what he is enjoying at
the moment. Should it ever be different, let us
hope we shall know how to meet it. Meanwhile,
let us think as little as possible of to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘We can all see,’ said Lamia, ‘that such was
the spirit in which you travelled in your youth.
In your rhythmical record of the journey which
you took—not with Veronica, I believe,—along
this meandering coast-line, there is never a stanza,
a line, even a word, to indicate that the myrtle
ever ceases to bloom, or that the sun ever forgets
to shine.’</p>

<p>‘You forget there is a terrific storm,’ said
Veronica, whose acquaintance with the Poe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>t’s
verse, though less frequently exhibited, is, I must
confess, a good deal more intimate than Lamia’s.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Lamia, quite undisconcerted, ‘only
to disappear with the return of dawn, and never
to be heard of again; and thenceforth we are told
of nothing but genial airs, temperate sunshine,
almond-trees and peach-trees ablow, and oleanders
reddening into bloom.’</p>

<p>‘You must remember,’ said the Poet, ‘that the
journey was made in the very flush and heyday of
the Spring; and, if I have in any way exaggerated
what I then beheld, was it not the proper exaggeration
of rapture? It is the instinctive
function of Art to reject, to select, and rightly
to magnify what remains. Looking back, I seem
to have omitted much, but to have exaggerated
nothing. Have you not observed that the first
impression we receive of scenery, as, indeed, of
people likewise, is the one that abides with us?
Many times since, I have beheld this tract betwixt
mountain and main veiled in mist, dimmed by
dust, even powdered with snow. But I always
think of it as I saw it first.’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill2"></a>
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">‘PEACH-TREES ABLOW’</div>
</div>

<p>‘Do you often think of Olympia?’ Lamia took
courage to ask, seeing the Poet so effusive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span> ‘Was
she very lovely?’</p>

<p>‘She was lovely beyond words,’ he answered,
readily responding to her humour. ‘In fact, my
recollection of her is that she was as perfect as the
scenery in which she moved and had her being.’</p>

<p>‘How nice! I wish I had been Olympia, except
that she seems to have had rather a scanty allowance
of luggage for a longish journey, and no
appetite to speak of, seeing that, if I remember
rightly, she was quite satisfied with a missal and
some dried figs. I fear, after all, I should have
been but ill equipped for the character.‘
Veronica, to show her displeasure at Lamia’s
levity with things deemed sacred, had risen from
the olive bole on which she was sitting, and moved
towards the sea. Lamia, quick to take a hint,
went on, but with an altered voice:</p>

<p>‘Tell me, dear Poet, what took you first to
Italy.’</p>

<p>‘An irrepressible longing. It was first aroused in
me, I think, by reading, in tender years, Arnold’s
<cite>History of Rome</cite>, whereby I believed as firmly in
the Palatine she-wolf, the leap into the Curtian
Gulf, the Rape of the Sabine Women, and the
nocturnal interviews of Numa and Egeria, as in
any of the immediate facts of one’s schoolboy
existence; nor did the iconoclastic criticism, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
which one perforce made acquaintance later on,
in any degree shake that cherished credulity.
What romantic prose originated, was consummated
by yet more wizard verse. To no mediæval
scholar was Virgil more of a magician than to me,
and not even Dante would say of him with more
truth—</p>

<p>
<i lang="it">Tu se’ lo mio maestro e il mio autore.</i><br />
</p>

<p>I kept repeating, long before I could translate
them into action, the words addressed by Æneas
to his immortal Mother, when she appeared to him
in the guise of a huntress in the Carthaginian forest,
<i lang="la">Italiam quaero patriam</i>; for already it seemed to
be a second fatherland. And when, at length, the
moment arrived that the longing could be indulged,
the only words I could find to express my
joy were—</p>

<p>
<i lang="la">Tendimus in Latium, sedes ubi fata quietas<br />
Ostendunt.</i><br />
</p>

<p>‘Stop, stop,’ said Lamia, ‘I wish I understood
Latin, but you know I don’t.‘</p>

<p>‘Then,’ he replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span> ‘do as I did before I first
went to Italy, being then much of the age that you
are now. I bought the best Italian grammar I
could find, and worked at it as a schoolboy is made
to work at the elementary rules of a dead language.
I studied the dictionary in like manner; so that,
when I went to the new land, I might not long
feel quite a stranger there.’</p>

<p>‘The very thing I have been doing, until my
brain seems a repository for the various inflections
of the subjunctive mood; and, as Veronica corrects
my pronunciation, I hope, by the time we reach
Latium, to be more or less understanded of the
people. But please do not let us concern ourselves
with either my shortcomings or my accomplishments;
but rather tell me, while I make you some
coffee in this windless atmosphere, how you first
went to Italy, and when.‘
‘It is a long story and will occupy some little
time.’</p>

<p>‘And so will the making of coffee, if it is to be
made properly,’ said Veronica, who had now
returned to us, and to whose superior powers
Lamia only too willingly surrendered that delicate
task.</p>

<p>‘One likes to think,’ he began, ‘that Heaven
interests itself in one’s training; and so I used
self-flatteringly to conceive that a special care
arranged the conditions under which one first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
beheld the shore of Liguria. I had taken boat
at Marseilles direct for Leghorn; and, in ordinary
circumstances, we should have passed some thirty-six
hours on the open sea, far from sight or surmise
of land. It was, therefore, through no intelligent
design of one’s own, but through the
sheer bounty of the gods, that the engine broke
down a few hours after we had left Marseilles, but
not so completely but that we could continue our
journey. The result was that we had to hug the
shore nearly the whole way. It was the September
equinox, and the moon was full; so night and day
we gazed on that bewitching coast; bay after bay,
town after town, village after village, mountain-range
after mountain-range, unfolding themselves
to my untravelled gaze. In the course of our
present journey, we shall pass ever and again
through gloomy arcades and narrow ways whose
unseemly aspect will probably shock Veronica and
perhaps please none of us. But distance, the
enchanter, presented them to me then as consisting
mainly of granite palaces and marble belfries; and
in every fold of every hill nestled villages that
seemed built of porphyry, and wherefrom soared,
intermediaries between earth and heaven, many-storied
<i lang="it">campanili</i>, whose chimes, as they pealed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
<i lang="la">Angelus</i> or <i lang="la">Ave Maria</i>, we could sometimes
faintly hear. There was no cloud in the sky,
scarce a ripple on the water, nothing but sunlight
or moonlight in the air. Sleep would have
been a desecration of so ethereal a scene; and
I well remember watching the rounded moon wax
paler and paler as the morning sun reddened up
over the wave, and then sink, as in despair of
rivalry, behind the hills.‘
‘O, I say, it’s boiling!’ said Lamia.</p>

<p>I hope everybody knows that, in making coffee,
that is exactly what it should not be allowed to
do; and I fear Lamia had a malicious pleasure in
finding Veronica for once at fault. I cannot but
suppose that Veronica had heard the foregoing
story many times before, but she catches fire so
readily from any one’s enthusiasm for Italy, that
she had almost allowed the coffee to do the same.
But she so deftly rescued it from hurt, that, unheeding
of Lamia’s exclamation, he went on:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>
<p>‘I saw, what we shall not see, many a form of
half-mysterious loveliness flit by me under flowing
veil down the steps of narrow streets in the
Ligurian Capital,—for we touched for a few hours
at Genoa,—and heard, what we shall not hear,
jovial-looking monks vociferating Vespers in the
Baptistery at Pisa; and then, Lamia, then! I was
borne, I scarce know how, along <i lang="it">Val d’ Arno</i>
through unending vineyard-avenues that seemed
to have dyed the leaves with the colour of their
purple fruit, and amongst which sun-bronzed
youths, who appeared to disport rather than to
toil, were singing love-songs to gaily-kirtled
maidens. The fawn-coloured <i lang="it">bovi</i> oscillated
homeward to the wine-vat, dragging after them
the grape-piled <i lang="it">carri</i> with their wooden wheels;
children and lizards, seemingly of kindred race,
twisted in and out among the workers; and,
stately of stature and sober of mien, dark-haired
matrons stood outside their spacious but unluxurious
homes, plaiting straw with rhythmically-moving
fingers that never seemed to tire. Then
came hills more rounded, softer declivities, a
gradual narrowing of the plain, a forest of domes,
belfries, and towers, and I was in Florence.‘</p>

<p>‘Why was your visit so brief?’</p>

<p>‘You ask why. Can one give a reason for
anything one does in one’s youth? Only I remember,
as I reluctantly quitted it, I vowed to
return to it ere long.‘</p>

<p>‘And you kept your vow,’ said Veronica.</p>

<p>‘I remember,’ said Lamia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>‘You remember what?’ I asked. ‘You must
have been in your cradle.’</p>

<p>‘Then I suppose,’ she replied, ‘I was extraordinarily
precocious.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>‘Lamia is very unmerciful,’ said the Poet, ‘and
does not allow one to forget the sins of one’s
youth. But it is quite true that, before the leaves
had fallen, one was again on one’s way to Italy;
not along this sybaritic coast, but through the
austere gorges, now green, now gray, of the
Simplon. When, having left the summit behind
us, we zigzagged downward, the mountains began
to wear a gentler aspect, the vegetation seemed
more ample and more unrestrained, the air more
soft, the sky farther off and more ethereal; and
suddenly I caught sight of a huge granite cross,
on the outstretched arms of which was deeply cut
the word <i lang="it">Italia</i>! I trembled with delight; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
from that hour to this, the word “Italy” has
never lost its magic. On we deviously descended,
past slopes of intermittent chestnut groves
whose leaves, fantastically faded, had not yet
fallen, till my driver exclaimed, “Eccolo!
Signore!” and there basked Baveno by the edge
of the lake in the setting sun, and the Borromean
Islands seemed rather floating in the air than resting
on the water. It was a true Saint Luke’s
summer, where all things seemed stationary in a
season of arrested change before the winter winds
should arise and everything pass away. I have
never again seen Nature in a mood of such absolute
abstraction and self-contemplation; and she
communicated to one’s spirit her own autumnal
detachment from the seasons that are feverish with
growth, and the seasons that are shaken by decay.‘</p>

<p>The description of suspended animation in the
natural world seemed to infect us with a kindred
tranquillity, and for awhile there followed it a
sympathetic silence.</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Lamia at length,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> ‘your aversion
to the curiosity of the interviewer. But is it
permissible to ask if it might not be worth while
to record some such reminiscences as you have just
recited; in a word,—do not be angry with me,—
to do what so many other people have done, and
to write an autobiography?’</p>

<p>‘I have written it,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘And when shall you publish it?’</p>

<p>‘Dear Lamia, it is published already.‘
‘I do not understand,’ she said, ‘for certainly
it is unknown to me.’</p>

<p>‘I fancy not,’ he replied. ‘Indeed, I gather
that you have paid me the compliment of reading
much of it more than once.’</p>

<p>As Lamia still seemed puzzled, Veronica broke
in with a slight touch of impatience:</p>

<p>‘You are scarcely as intelligent as usual, Lamia.
Surely what he means you to understand is that a
man’s works are his autobiography.‘</p>

<p>‘Exactly. But enough surely—perhaps somewhat
too much—of that subject; and our little
horses are ringing a carillon with their bells, as if
to remind us it is time we were again on our way.’</p>

<p>‘One moment,’ said Lamia, raising her hand
deprecatingly. ‘Before we quit this first fair spot
of rest in Southern air, grace must be said for our
<i lang="it">al fresco</i> repast. You know what form we like
that grace to take. Be it as brief as you will, but
it must be in verse.’</p>

<p>‘We are not in Sicily,’ he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span> ‘nor am I
Theocritus. But Veronica asked me the other day
if I could give her some idea of the short pastoral
idylls written two thousand years ago, which not
all of us can read, but of which all of us have
heard. I am not so presumptuous as to suppose I
have succeeded in responding adequately to her
wish; but perhaps our almost Sicilian surroundings,
and the indulgent temper of the hour, may confer
on the attempt something of the appropriateness it
would otherwise lack.</p>

The Poet has since told me that these lines are a free paraphrase of an
idyll by Leonidas of Tarentum, who lived in the time of Pyrrhus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p></div>

<p>Then up we got, and onward we went, past
rocks, and waves, and arbutus, and white heath,—not
the white heath of home, but towering and
flowering fifteen or even twenty feet into the air,—and
<i>Cineraria maritima</i>, and Bacchic ivy, groups
of eucalyptus and acacia, and glimpses of hill and
sky, with here and there a hurrying zigzag torrent.
What seaweed there was, was golden, and the
surging and swirling of the silvery water over and
among it and the red rocks was strangely beautiful.
The liliputian waves kept coming on and breaking,
as in any other sea, but never advancing. As
Lamia said, what motion there was seemed purposeless
motion, resembling the sport of children rather
than the work of grown-up people. But her
greatest delight was yet to come; for, late that
afternoon, she beheld the first orange-grove glittering
and glistening on the sunny outskirts of a
gray-roofed little town, whose bright green <i lang="fr">jalousies</i>
more than relieved what would otherwise have
seemed its somewhat sombre aspect. Thoughtful
Veronica made her take the seat in the carriage
where she might command them best, and her
spoken raptures were what we all, though more
travelled than she, silently felt.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>
<p>‘O, the Garden that you love is nothing,
nothing, nothing, compared with this, which is not
a garden at all, but a fairy grove of light and
lustre. Do let us stop and pluck some of the
golden fruit!’</p>

<p>‘Better not,’ said Veronica, ‘for doing so might
dissipate your dream. They are lovely to look at,
but indifferent to the taste. Neither is it their
best season. Wait to gather oranges till, if ever,
you are at Sorrento in the heart of May.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the Poet, ‘these are well enough;
but they are a feeble imitation of their fellows in
the real South, the true Ausonia.’</p>

<p>Lamia was as ready to believe everything she
was told as to admire everything she saw; and
her only lament was that, even though moving
at a leisurely pace, beautiful scene after beautiful
scene was withdrawn from her gaze along
that winding road, almost before she could really
behold it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill4"></a>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ORANGE GROVE, MENTONE</div>
</div>

<p>There came a stage in our journey which, as
you may suppose, was not by any means one of a
single day, when I felt certain a question would
arise likely to lead to some difference of opinion,
and I was curious to see how it would arrange
itself. But, like Lamia herself, who was the person
mainly interested, I carefully avoided all allusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
to it. She, with infinitely more tact, as becomes a
woman, kept gradually and dexterously leading
up to it, while seeming to be quite unconscious
of it, and indeed as if moving in quite an opposite
direction.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Veronica, with that perfect freedom
from afterthought or unspoken inner thought so
characteristic of her, ‘now we turn inland and
ascend. Say good-bye to the coast-line, which you
will not see again till we reach the summit.’</p>

<p>‘And say good-bye likewise,’ added the Poet,
‘to the Provençal tongue, that seems to bear
much about the same relation to French that the
Venetian dialect bears to Italian, and to have
retained the indefinable charm of flowers, perfume,
and poetry that hovered round the cradle
of modern verse, and has been handed down to
us from the lips of lovely ladies and obeisant
troubadours.’</p>

<p>Lamia showed no appreciation of these observations,
as I could well perceive, and went on
inwardly concerting a well-calculated strategy of
her own.</p>

<p>‘How long will it take us,’ she asked, with
apparent unconcern, ‘to reach the summit?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps a couple of hours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>‘
‘And to descend?’</p>

<p>‘To descend where?’ asked Veronica, who, I
think, began to suspect what was fermenting in
Lamia’s mind.</p>

<p>‘Anywhere,’ answered Lamia. ‘I mean where
we reach, as you said, the coast-line again.’</p>

<p>‘An hour perhaps,’ I said.</p>

<p>Then followed a short interval of silence or
truce, broken by Lamia, who, far too strategic
to attack the question in front, was now evidently
meditating a flank movement which interested me
greatly.</p>

<p>‘Do you remember my once saying that I
wished I were a poet?’</p>

<p>‘Dear Lamia, I can only say to you, as one so
often has to write to unknown correspondents who
send one verse, the intention of which is better
than its execution,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘To have the great poetic heart</div>
  <div class="verse">Is more than all poetic fame.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘But, when one has neither,’ she replied, bringing
her forces rapidly into action, and resolved at all
costs to turn Veronica’s position,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> ‘it is so nice and
so advantageous to be taken about by one who has
both.’</p>

<p>To the Poet himself, I am sure, this seemed
rather wide of the mark; but it was just one of
those complimentary exaggerations which Lamia
invariably employs when she wants to propitiate
Veronica.</p>

<p>‘By one who has both,’ she went on, ‘and
accordingly is everywhere vouchsafed a welcome not
only for himself, but for all who travel in his train.
It was not <em>very</em> comfortable last night at that
picturesque <i lang="it">locanda</i>; and I confess I am looking
forward to the prosaic domestic comforts that are
promised us this evening.’</p>

<p>I confess I did not follow the workings of her
mind, and almost began to suspect that I had
imputed to her a design of which she was innocent.
But I was quickly confirmed again in my original
surmise.</p>

<p>‘Was this country very different when you saw
it first from what it is now?’</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, and no,’ replied the Poet, falling
into the trap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span> ‘Different where Pleasure and
Fashion have invaded it: not different where
Nature maintains her native dominion. Along the
road, then the only one, we are now ascending,
nothing seems to be altered. What change <em>has</em>
taken place you will perceive very shortly, when
we arrive at the summit. Then one looked down
only on the austere towers and jutting promontory
of a rock-bound sea-moated Principality. Now,—but
never mind!’</p>

<p>‘But I <em>do</em> mind. I am greatly interested in
these changes.’ Then suddenly, ‘Veronica! Has
it not struck you that we shall arrive at our
journey’s end to-day in the middle of the afternoon,
when you know you never like guests to present
themselves? Do you not think it would be better
if we got there towards tea-time?‘</p>

<p>‘Yes, I think it would; and we can easily loiter
along the road.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Veronica!’ said Lamia in her most
impulsive accents and her most irresistible manner,
‘<em>do</em> let us loiter <em>there</em> then, if only for an
hour!’</p>

<p>‘Where?’ said Veronica.</p>

<p>‘O, you know what I mean. <em>There!</em>’</p>

<p>‘But we should have to retrace our steps.‘
‘A couple of miles only,’ I said, seizing the
opportunity to curry favour with Lamia.</p>

<p>‘It is odious,’ said Veronica.</p>

<p>‘It certainly is,’ added the Poet; ‘the most
offensive place I know.’</p>

<p>‘It was not <i lang="it">Spiaggiascura</i>, was it!’ exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Lamia in a tone of pathetic tenderness I never
heard equalled, laying her hand gently on the
Poet’s arm. ‘If it was, of course, I will not
ask it.’</p>

<p>‘No, it was not Spiaggiascura,’ he replied.
‘Better to think of that as a name that has no
local habitation.’</p>

<p>Lamia had conquered. That last inimitable
touch of pathos, which was moreover, I am sure,
entirely sincere, had disarmed Veronica’s scruples
and the Poet’s fastidiousness. By the time three
more hours had gone by, we had seen it all,
and were sitting under a brown awning, partaking
of iced coffee to the strains of a Hungarian
band.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid I rather like it,’ said Lamia.</p>

<p>‘Why should you not?’ said the Poet.</p>

<p>‘Not the gambling, surely?’ asked Veronica.</p>

<p>‘Not the gambling, dear Veronica, so long as I
have you at my side to buttress my somewhat shaky
virtue.’ Then turning to me, ‘You know, of old,
that I have low tastes.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ observed the Poet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> ‘I confess that an
earnest desire to be indulgent to whatever is human
has never succeeded in eradicating the feeling that
gambling is the lowest of all human diversions;
and, though here you need neither share nor
even see it unless you wish, it seems to me to cast
its ignoble shadow over the entire place, and to
dethrone it from the majestic position with which
Nature originally invested it. It has infected the
architecture, vulgarised the sea-front, corrupted the
very air, and exercised a malefic influence on
manners.’</p>

<p>‘And it has certainly spoilt the looks of the
men and women,’ said Lamia. ‘I never saw so
many ugly people as round those fascinating
tables.’</p>

<p>‘Gambling would make any one ugly,’ said
Veronica.</p>

<p>‘Then I will never gamble,’ said Lamia.</p>

<p>‘Let us leave this,’ I ventured to suggest, ‘and
sit among the flower-beds, somewhat too artificial
though I allow they are.’</p>

<p>‘They look combed and curled,’ said Lamia.
‘I am sure I am quite as natural as they are.’</p>

<p>‘Dante had so exhaustive an imagination,’ observed
the Poet, when we had shifted our position,
‘that it is not easy to suggest any form of repugnant
penalty not to be met with in the <cite>Divine Comedy</cite>.
But I think what is colloquially called a Hell might
be added to his repulsive Circles. What Lamia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
said just now is strikingly true. The place has a
malign effect on people’s appearance. Look at
those respectable persons—for I am sure they are
such—trying to appear almost the reverse. Great-granddaughters
of the Pilgrim Fathers are collected
here, just as cold no doubt as their grandmothers,
but striving to seem otherwise. Looking back to
those years when I first wandered along this lovely
region, when this place had neither existence nor
name, I cannot but regret the simplicity that has
passed away. Nor can I think it is well for the
idlers of material civilisation to parade their
opulent <i lang="fr">ennui</i> before a primitive people whom they
will probably end by infecting with their restlessness
and their discontent.‘</p>

<p>‘I can see,’ said Lamia, ‘this is my first and
last visit to this vicious Circle.’</p>

<p>‘Come, then,’ he answered, rising, and we all
did the same,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> ‘and see how unnecessarily intolerant
one can be, and how narrow is the slip of territory
that modern pleasures have filched from peasant
life and rustic toil. In a few minutes we shall be
among the olive woods. Are we not there already?
See! bare-headed women are washing the clothes
of their husbands and children in the Grima.
Look there, beyond! The goats are clambering
up the precipitous slopes, and browsing on the
myrtle. What now do we behold through sunny
openings in dense dark foliage? Meditating
mountains and laughing sea. Let us recant all
we have said. There is room enough in this large
world for everybody, and manifestly quite enough
for us. Man has wrung from Nature a slight
concession along the coast, but here, as everywhere,
the Hinterland belongs to Heaven.’</p>

<p>There was little exaggeration in the words. An
ascent as easy as it was brief carried us beyond the
sights and sounds of what Veronica had, with just
alliteration, stigmatised as ‘cosmopolitan canaille,’
and shortly we were sitting on myrtle-cushioned
boulders, and gazing out, through gaps in the
silvery foliage of the olive-trees, at a sea unchanged
since the days when Hercules is reputed to have
traversed it.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Lamia penitently;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> ‘I own this is
better than the chink of five-franc pieces, the
lavishly gilded ceilings, and the hungry faces
fastened on the gyrations of a whirligig. Yet, the
rooms are crowded, and we have the woods to
ourselves. The perversity that governs the lives
of so many of us is, I have often felt, a strong
argument against Free Will; and never seemed it
more so than here where, in the most enchanting
spot I have as yet beheld, men and women are
most artificial, and most intent on the ugliest of
pursuits.’</p>

<p>Thereupon—for have you not remarked that
the oldest subjects of discourse are precisely those
which best preserve their freshness?—the conversation,
in this mountain solitude, began to travel, if
somewhat discursively, over trite ground, in the
course of which Lamia rather ingeniously suggested
that, as with every other human faculty, our will
is partly free, in part under the sway of necessity.
The discussion, if discussion it can be called, was
confined to three of us; for the Poet remained
a silent listener.</p>

<p>‘Have you nothing,’ said Veronica at length,
‘to contribute to our deliberations? Can you not
give us any help in our perplexity?’</p>

<p>‘I almost think I can,’ he said, ‘but not by
any formal dialectic. Yet is not a universal
conviction, of which it is impossible for human
beings to divest themselves, as convincing as the
most logical demonstration? Once after listening,
by no means for the first time, to the arguments
you have yet again been urging, there came to me
the following reflections:—</p>

<p>An hour or so later, just as mountain and main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
began to exchange the resplendent garments of
sundown for twilight’s more sober mantle, Veronica
leaned forward, and, pointing to a motionless
figure that with dark flowing plumes and glittering
bayonet stood out silhouetted against the sky,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>‘See, Lamia! You are in Italy.’</p>

</div>


<h2 class="no-break"><a id="II"></a>LAMIA’S WINTER-QUARTERS</h2>


<p>‘I wonder,’ said Lamia, ‘who invented the phrase,
“the sunny South”?‘</p>

<p>‘A poet, no doubt,’ I answered, with perhaps a
slight touch of malice; ‘one who, in Bacon’s
phrase, accommodates the shows of things to the
affections of the mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>.‘</p>

<p>‘That is all very well when you are not in
immediate contact with the things themselves.
But here we have been for forty-eight hours, and
we have not seen the sun yet. Tuscany could
hardly have behaved worse.’</p>

<p>‘All of us, even the most prosaic,’ said the
Poet, ‘are makers of phrases only approximately
true; but even to-morrow perhaps you will have
to own that this southward-sloping coast is not
undeserving of its fame.’</p>

<p>He proved to be right. The following sunrise
rebuked Lamia’s lament; and, when we assembled
at breakfast in our English fashion, she declared
she could have dressed before the open window,
had Veronica but permitted it.</p>

<p>Still let it be confessed that ‘the sunny South’
is a phrase that partakes of some exaggeration.
The South is sunnier, much sunnier, than the
North; but it, too, can have its days of gloom,
and even its weeks of capricious temper. Moreover,
there is South, and South; and, despite
Lamia’s somewhat hazardous assertion that
Tuscany could hardly have been more inclement
than it had been in our new quarters for the
first two days after our arrival, there is, as the
rest of us well knew, a vast difference between
its winter climate and that of the favoured
region where, for Lamia’s sake, we awhile were
halting.</p>

<p>‘Veronica, you grow more wonderful every
day,’ she exclaimed, under the influence of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>-glorifying
sunlight. ‘You have discovered a
paradise, by sheer intuition.’</p>

<p>It is not the first time allusion has been made
to Veronica’s executive talents. They are so much
greater than the rest of us possess, that, when
anything serviceable has to be done, she reduces us
all to insignificance. Without counsel or assistance
from any one, and entirely by correspondence,
she had procured for us, for three months, a home
that we all, with enthusiastic sincerity, declared to
be enchanting. If you think that an easy matter,
I can only say, ‘Try for yourselves.’ It is this
special difficulty that drives so many people who
spend the winter months in the South of Europe
to pass them in hotels. One and all we had
avowed that we would sooner a thousand times
remain at home than resort to that depressing expedient.
Yet pretentious, trim, and conventional
villas, with their cut-and-combed lawns, their
formal palm-trees and dracænas, and their beds of
dubious-coloured cinerarias, are the alternative
that, for the most part, remains; and I imagine
you know that would have consorted but little
better with our tastes.</p>

<p>‘I knew what you all wanted,’ said Veronica;
‘but let us,’ she added modestly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span> ‘give thanks to
Fortune, who has had far more to do with it
than I.’</p>

<p>I verily believe that something, moreover, should
be ascribed to the comparative slenderness of our
purse and to the simplicity of our tastes; nor do I
pretend that what Lamia flatteringly called a paradise
regained would have been much short of a
purgatory to many splendidly-fastidious people.
Our new abode had neither architectural design nor
internal pretension; but the taste of man, in partnership
with time, had given it charm without and
refinement within. Do you remember how, in that
search which finally planted us in the Garden that
we Love, we kept recalling the words of Tacitus
as applied to the race whose preferences run so
strongly in our own blood: <i lang="la">Suam quisque domum
spatio circumdat</i>? I hope we have nothing to conceal,
but is not a sense of seclusion necessary to
felicity? Unlike folk of Northern blood, the Latin
race, and the Italian race more especially, have
little taste for privacy, and none for solitude. To
lean out of the open window onto the street or
highway below, to sit on door-steps whence they
can see and accost chance passers-by, to talk, to
sing, to dance, this is their idea of such happiness
as life permits. But the very spaciousness of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
hills, their plains, their valleys, affords to the more
meditative children of the mist even larger facilities
than our own land for gratifying the passion for
that ‘life removed’ which the Duke in <cite>Measure
for Measure</cite>, probably expressing Shakespeare’s
own personal taste, says he had ‘ever loved.’
Veronica had found it for us here. The spurs of
the Maritime Alps, as they decline and dwindle
towards the sea, enclose a series of gorges and
ravines of various forms and dimensions. Some
are narrow, gloomy, and precipitous, others gradual,
well open to the sun, not too deep-bosomed, and
gladdened by streams that have their source in
remoter mountain-sheds. It was in one of the
latter we had discovered the shelter and seclusion
we desired. No wind could visit us roughly; for,
if it blew from the north, we were curtained by the
hills, and, should it rage from the sea, we were just
sufficiently away from the shore, and protected
enough in that direction by olive-slopes and orange-groves
to be apprised of its displeasure only by an
unusual rustling of leaves.</p>

<p>‘But what do you propose to do in this ravine
of rest?’ Lamia inquired of me somewhat mockingly.
‘Veronica is never without occupation;
and here she will be abundantly employed in scour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>ing
the neighbouring hamlets for fowls that have
not become all bone and sinew by constant mountaineering,
in checking the washing-book, and in
raising the moral tone of the young people along
the entire countryside. As for me, a determination
to master the Tuscan tongue will give
me rest from the fatigue of too much idleness;
and my new tutor, the young ecclesiastic, whom
Veronica has enticed from the Sacristy for my
benefit, is quite charming, and makes me willing,
as he also seems to be, to prolong indefinitely the
time nominally allotted to the most fascinating of
studies. But you? You cannot “garden” here, for
the ground seems to do that of itself; nor, in any
case, will you have time to pique yourself on the
result of your labours, which, I have observed, is
the main motive power of those persons who are
supposed to love flowers for themselves.‘</p>

<p>Wishing to divert her playful arrows from myself,
I replied that I was indeed rather gravelled
for lack of employment, and so intended to try
if sitting in the sun and doing nothing would
supply the deficiency; and I then added that
she had forgotten to include the Poet in the
catalogue of the unemployed.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill5"></a>
<img src="images/i_077.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PEAR-BLOSSOM, MARITIME ALPS</div>
</div>

<p>‘O, the Poet?’ she replied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span> ‘That is <i lang="it">un altro
paio di maniche</i>,—you see my devoted subdeacon is
teaching me the proverbs of his lovely language,—for
he abides in a lofty ether whither I fear my
shafts would never reach him. For anything I
can tell, he may be writing an adorable sonnet
when he is tapping the top of an egg-shell at the
breakfast table; and I often suspect he is, in reality,
in a fine frenzy, when he appears to be listening
deferentially to one of my shallowest disquisitions.’</p>

<p>‘Would you marry a poet?’ I asked. I should
have half liked to make the inquiry more definite;
but for that I had not the courage.</p>

<p>‘Marry a poet!’ she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span> ‘I should think
not indeed. Poor Veronica! She manages tolerably
well with hers, thanks to her good sense and infinite
patience; and perhaps she is not as sorely tried as
she deserves to be for the irreparable experiment to
which she has committed herself. For us women
marriage is necessarily the chief mercantile transaction
of our lives; and, if one marries a peer, one
becomes a peeress; if one weds a millionaire, one
may hope to be a million-heiress. But the wife of
a poet does not become a poetess. She cannot share
with him his only valuable asset; and the supposed
romantic nature of his disposition, which is usually
a sheer fiction, not unoften diverts from her the
curiosity to which every woman is entitled, and which
every woman who marries reasonably invariably gets.’</p>

<p>‘But if you happen to love a poet?’ I persisted.</p>

<p>She quickly made me repent my question.
‘You are unteachable. Love is a terminable
annuity, that ends long before death, leaving one’s
declining days to abject poverty.‘</p>

<p>At this juncture I saw Veronica and the Poet
coming along the rose <i>pergola</i>, for January roses
were pretty abundant with us, and I inwardly
wished they had come sooner, for Lamia would
not have dared to say such things in their presence;
reserving, as she seems to do, her most outrageous
utterances for my private benefit. But then, it
is true, I should not in that case have put my
useless interrogatories.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ she said, ‘I am going to burn some
incense before the Poet.’</p>

<p>‘You know he loathes it,’ I observed.</p>

<p>‘Do you think I should proffer it so liberally if
he liked it? We were talking,’ she said, addressing
him, as he joined us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span> ‘of how we are to occupy
ourselves in the quiet and unexciting quarters
Veronica has provided for us. You, of course, can
write a long poem, and I should think this is just
the place for doing so, though I observe that
people nowadays deprecate the writing of long
poems as being out of date.’</p>

<p>‘I trust,’ he replied, ‘that will have no influence
on their being written or not being
written. Novel reading, I fear, has proved somewhat
injurious to the more serious side of the imagination,
and prose fiction has created a distaste
for sustained works in verse. If Milton lived
to-day, <cite>L’Allegro</cite> and <cite>Il Penseroso</cite> would perhaps
still be more or less appreciated; but <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite> would of a certainty be condemned as tedious.
Even in his own day it had only fit audience but
few, and few are always enough, if fit.‘</p>

<p>‘I hope,’ said Lamia, ‘that we who are here
would answer to that description; yet you never
read what you are writing either to Veronica or to
me. I have often wondered what is the reason.’</p>

<p>‘The reason is very simple,’ he replied. ‘Veronica
is rather difficult, you are somewhat easy, to please;
and, while she might make me too distrustful, you,
dear Lamia, would, I fear, render me too enamoured
of my work. It is best, I think, oneself to be its
critic, and as searching and severe a one as possible;
and then to leave it with all its imperfections on
its head, which are sure to be very numerous, but
are at least one’s own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>.‘</p>

<p>‘I wonder,’ she said, ‘how poetry is written.’</p>

<p>‘If I could tell you that,’ he answered, ‘you
might conceivably take advantage of the information
to become a formidable rival. But, as far as
I can help you, I should say poetry is a natural
and indeed inevitable form of expression, as I
suppose music also is, in a certain mood or
state.’</p>

<p>‘And how is the state brought about?’ she
asked.</p>

<p>A smile came over his face as he replied: ‘I
wish I knew. Perhaps by consorting with Lamias,
when they are not too inquisitive.’</p>

<p>Veronica remained seated beside us, while he
resumed his walk under the roses. When he had
passed out of hearing, Veronica turned to Lamia a
little austerely, and said:</p>

<p>‘There are some persons—usually you are not
one of them—who are perpetually trying to invade
the sanctuary of one’s soul, with the result that
one double-locks the doors. Only those who
come to worship, not to scrutinise, are admitted.
Have we not already been told,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘What is it rules thy singing season?</div>
  <div class="verse">Instinct, that diviner Reason,</div>
  <div class="verse">To which the wish to know seemeth a sort of treason.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span></p>
<p>‘And again,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Why dost thou ever cease to sing?</div>
  <div class="verse">Singing is such sweet comfort, who,</div>
  <div class="verse">If he could sing the whole year through,</div>
  <div class="verse">Would barter it for anything?’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Would you like him to sing the whole year
through?’ asked Lamia.</p>

<p>Veronica made no reply; for, though the
question was put with an air of perfect seriousness,
it might have been interpreted otherwise. So
Lamia went on:</p>

<p>‘I suppose I do not understand, because I am
not married, and still less have the felicity to be
married to a poet. But, if I were, I fear I should
be exacting enough to wish to be even sweeter
comfort to him than his singing. He paid you a
great compliment, Veronica, the other day, when
you were not present; for at the end of an interesting
discussion,—interesting, at least, to me,—he
said: “The sum of the matter is, bad wives are as
rare as good husbands.” Yet I confess it seems to
me the worst husband in the world would be one
who could find consolation in perpetual carolling.
I would rather he beat me.‘
I need scarcely say that I heartily sympathised,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
though without having the courage to say so, with
these sentiments of Lamia, albeit it is not easy
to decide if they were really hers or not. She
has a fine Socratic talent for eliciting information;
and she was as successful on this occasion as
usual, for, much to my surprise, Veronica, after
a brief silence, rendered necessary perhaps by the
violence of Lamia’s closing observation, said very
quietly:</p>

<p>‘I should like, if I may, to recite some lines he
wrote the other day, which seem to bear on your
misgivings, if but indirectly, and may perhaps help
to diminish them.’ Thereupon she recited, much
better, I thought, than the Poet himself, the following
apology:—</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Lamia’s anxiety lest we should
find ourselves short of agreeable occupation, our
familiarity with a quiet and unexciting existence
enabled us to pass many delightful days, while none
were without their incidents and their pleasures.
If I attempted to describe these, they might
possibly appear monotonous to you; but they
were not monotonous to us. Excursions to
ruined castles, to picturesquely-perched villages,
to slopes and summits famous for their wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>-flowers,
are enchanting to those who make them;
but one is hardly justified in demanding sustained
attention for them from others. In life, as in
Art, Nature is an excellent background to the
actions and passions of human beings; and our
almost daily quest of natural beauty was not unattended
by experiences that aroused a feeling of
pathos, unsealed the sources of pity, or awakened
the always welcome sense of humour. The
young ecclesiastic who was engaged in the agreeable
task of reading Italian with Lamia was good
enough to wish that we should pay him a visit,
though he warned us, with much well-bred dignity,
that his home was very humble, and that his
reception of us would be equally so. He lived
in an up-and-down hamlet among the hills;
and we made the excursion, Veronica and Lamia
on mules, the Poet and I on foot, with much
willingness. Lamia spoke of him as her subdeacon;
but I believe he was as yet only in
minor orders. He already wore, however, the
ecclesiastical garb, and he had all the grave
demeanour of his destined calling. He made no
secret of the modesty of his origin, and confessed,
with perfect simplicity, that he had chosen the
sacerdotal state because, while having lettered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
tastes, he could so best support his mother, who
was a widow, and his two young sisters. He
had contrived to pick up several volumes of the
classics, which evidently were much dearer to him
than the theological tomes that kept them company;
and he frankly declared that, while deeply
attached to his Creed, he would gladly divest
himself of the cassock, if we would only take him
to England, and put him in the way of earning
a livelihood by such agreeable labours as he was
engaged on with Lamia. Before we left, he asked
if he might read us one of the many Sonnets
he had composed in his abundant leisure; and
it was impossible to listen to it without feeling
that he was animated by that desire to
extend the horizon of his existence, which makes
the lives of so many students in Italy, both
ecclesiastic and lay, so deeply pathetic. As
we descended the hill, after visiting with him
the unpretending chapel where he would one
day minister, we lapsed into a compassionate
silence, which I finally broke, knowing that we
were all thinking the same thing, by repeating,
though rather absently, the lovely if hackneyed
Virgilian line:—</p>

<p>
‘<i lang="la">Sunt lachrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt</i>’<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>I could not be sorry that I had done so; for
instantly the Poet, translating the line, said: ‘Yes.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘These are the things that cause the tears to start,</div>
  <div class="verse">And human sorrows touch the human heart.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Did you notice the artificial flowers on the
altar?’ said Lamia; ‘and does it not seem strange
the peasants should proffer these, when their hills
furnish them with natural ones, in such abundance,
of exquisite beauty and fragrance?’</p>

<p>‘It offends our taste,’ said Veronica; ‘but I
suppose the artificial flowers cost them something,
however little, while natural flowers would cost
them nothing save the gathering. They want to
give Heaven of their dearest and their best; and
their dearest and best, poor things, are their small
earnings and scant savings.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, that explains it,’ I said; ‘just as, when we
get to Florence, you will see the most fashionable
of its churches, the <i lang="it">Santissima Annunziata</i>,
bedizened all over with gold; gold being the
dearest and best thing with the fashionable. Thus,
both poor and rich alike are devout in their separate
and distinctive ways.’</p>

<p>Do what we would, and divert ourselves in our
simple, unpretending way as we might, we could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
not help thinking withal of Florence, referring to
Florence, and continually anticipating what Tuscany
had in store for us. Lamia was the most impatient
of us all, partly perhaps because she knew that
concern for her alone still kept us from our
bourne.</p>

<p>‘Please do not think,’ she said, one day, ‘that
I have not greatly enjoyed myself here. But what
is it—for there is something—that renders life on
this lovely strip of coast between the mountains
and the sea, after a brief sojourn, not quite satisfactory?’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill6"></a>
<img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">‘BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA’</div>
</div>

<p>‘Surely,’ said the Poet, ‘it is the insufficient
presence of the Past. Every spot in Europe, as
a matter of course, has had a Past of considerable
duration; and this lovely tract of country must
have had a chequered, and at times a very exciting
one. But its visible relics are few. The Roman
came and made his roads; the Saracen came and
ravaged; feudal bandit harried feudal bandit; and
the great bandit of our own century, Bonaparte,
dispatched and sometimes accompanied his armies
along it. But almost the sole vestiges of its
vanished vigour and virility are trivial ruins devoid
of architectural beauty; its villages are situated
most picturesquely, but they are as devoid of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
plastic beauty as an eagle’s eyrie; their churches
are touching in their devout simplicity, but, alike
within and without, lack the impress of the artist’s
mind, the artist’s hand. He has not been here;
or, if he has, the <i lang="it">condottiere</i> has destroyed all traces
of his work. Look at the sea. Byron most
happily called it ‘the image of Eternity,’ for its
Present is exactly like its Past, and its Future
will be only like its Present. Man can make no
impression on it, nor leave on it any trace of his
presence. Therefore, despite its sublimity, most
of us at last tire of gazing on it. It lacks human
interest. When it smiles, it enchants. When it
frowns, it overawes. But we cannot take it to
our heart; and something of the heartlessness of
the sea attaches to a land where neither poet,
architect, nor painter has bequeathed monuments
to remind us that here man has aspired and
striven, here woman consoled and suffered. But
be patient, Lamia. Florence is reserving for you
ample compensation.‘</p>

<p>‘And yet you, or Veronica, at least,’ said Lamia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
‘would not let us take up our
quarters at or even near,—but perhaps I had better not mention the
place. Only all you have said seems to justify those wicked people,
who find lemon-gardens and olive-groves insufficient for happiness,
and so have enlivened this lovely but unlively coast with casinos,
roulette-tables, and pigeon-shoots.’</p>

<p>‘And even the lemon-gardens and olive-groves,‘I said, ‘are fast
disappearing. As we have observed only too frequently, they are being
ruthlessly cut down, in order that, in their place, <i>Safrano</i> and
<i>Marie van Houtte</i> roses may be grown for Vienna, London, and Saint
Petersburg.’</p>

<p>‘And then,’ said Lamia, ‘there will be nothing
left but the mountains and the sea.’</p>

<p>‘That will be a considerable residuum,’ said
the Poet. ‘I happened to overhear a dialogue
between them the other day, which, if you are so
minded, I shall have much pleasure in repeating
to you.’</p>

<p>‘By all means,’ said Veronica. ‘Here, we are
in the presence of both; so they will be able to
judge if you report their colloquy correctly.’</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="III"></a>LAMIA’S WINTER-QUARTERS</h2>


<p>I heard the Poet’s voice in the balcony, followed
by the pushing back of heavy <i lang="it">persiane</i>, and then:</p>

<p>‘Lamia! Come as quickly as you can; I want
to show you what you may never have a chance
of seeing again.’</p>

<p>There was no reason why, if there was anything
new or wonderful to behold, Lamia and the
Poet should have a monopoly of the spectacle; so,
arraying myself as rapidly as I could, I emerged
onto the balcony just as Lamia, in incomplete but
most fascinating attire, did the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>‘Oh!’ she exclaimed. ‘What hills! What
slopes! What villas! But where is Florence?’</p>

<p>‘Wait,’ said the Poet, ‘and you shall see.
Like you, dear Lamia, she is very fair,’—how I
wish I had the courage to address her in that
fashion!—‘but, unlike you, she has not yet
flowered out of the night.’</p>

<p>‘Neither have I, quite, I fear,’ she said, showing,
when thuswise reminded, a quite unnecessary concern
respecting her hastily-donned apparel.</p>

<p>‘She is veiled, absolutely veiled, as I have never
seen her before, in a, shall I call it, <i lang="fr">peignoir</i> of
white mist, which conceals her utterly from sight.
But look! she is beginning to disrobe her marble
beauty.’</p>

<p>‘O, what is that, that surges through the
mist?‘
‘That is the noblest symbol of civic liberty in
the world, the Tower of the <i lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio</i>.’</p>

<p>‘And that? And that?‘
‘The topmost tier of Giotto’s Belfry, worthy,
by its sublime simplicity, to serve for the type
of all great Art; and, at its side in the rapidly-clearing
ether, the cupola of the Duomo, that
Michelangelo would not copy and could not
better.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>‘Dome after dome, tower after tower, <i lang="it">campanile</i>
after <i lang="it">campanile</i>, surged silently out of the mist;
and, to use the Poet’s I hope not too familiar
simile, the silvery folds of night sank downward
to her feet, and Florence stood in naked loveliness
before Lamia’s delighted gaze. Over the eastern
hills came the bright vernal sun, every mountain
slope broke into smiles and dimples, and in the
last of its seaward valleys Arno glanced and
gleamed with joy of the expanding dawn. Distance
lends enchantment to the sound as well as to the
view, and the clang and clash of innumerable
belfries came modulated through the intervening
air, wherefrom the last lingering trails of mist were
gradually wizarded away.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill7"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FLORENCE</div>
</div>

<p>Question and answer followed each other in
uninterrupted succession. Yes, that was <i lang="it">San
Miniato Al Monte</i>, with <i lang="it">La Bella Villanella</i>
hard by; and that beyond was <i lang="it">Santa Margherita</i>,
neighboured by the villa in which Guicciardini
completed his History. And yes,—Lamia was quite
right,—that was the <i lang="it">Torre del Gallo</i>, and away to
the right and farther up the hills was the Medicean
<i lang="it">Poggio-a-Cajano</i>, where Lorenzo wrote his
poem on the <i lang="it">Ambra</i>. Over the matchless panorama
of hill and valley her interrogatories wandered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
unceasingly, whilst we called on our recollection to
supply the names she asked for.</p>

<p>Suddenly, other <i lang="it">persiane</i> were pushed back, and
Veronica joined us.</p>

<p>‘What are you all doing?’</p>

<p>‘Do you remember,’ answered Lamia, ‘the wife
of Cosimo, Pater Patriæ, asking him, when advanced
in years, why he so often sate with closed eyes, and
his answering that he did so in order to accustom
them to what they must soon always be doing? I
am opening mine thus early, feeling that, in such
a world as this, I shall never be able to close them
again.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘It is perfect, absolutely perfect,’ said Lamia,
‘and no wonder Politian found it so.’</p>

<p>‘But did Politian really live here?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘Let us be wise enough to think so,’ said the
Poet, ‘and it was quite in keeping with Lorenzo’s
magnificence, when that testy scholar, to whom he
had committed the tuition of his sons, quarrelled
with Donna Clarice because she thought she also
should have something to say to their training, to
provide him with such a sanctuary. Besides, in
Italy, Tradition is not, as some one has said
she is elsewhere, a toothless old crone with memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
half gone, but the trustworthy depositary of unforgotten
glories.‘</p>

<p>‘It is more than a tradition,’ said Veronica.
‘Only this morning I came across a passage from
Politian’s correspondence, which would seem to
confirm local legend. Here it is. He is writing
to Lorenzo. “When you are incommoded by the
heat of the season at Careggi, you will perchance
bethink you of the shelter of my abode, nor deem
it undeserving of your notice. Nestled in the
sloping sides of the hill, we have here water in
abundance, and, being constantly refreshed by
moderate breezes, experience but little inconvenience
from the fervour of the sun. As you
approach the villa itself, it seems embosomed in
a grove; but, when you reach it, you discover
that it commands a full view of the city. Though
the neighbourhood is not without its denizens, I
can here enjoy the solitude so congenial to my
disposition. But I can offer you the temptation
of other allurements. Wandering beyond his own
boundaries, Pico della Mirandola sometimes steals
unexpectedly on my retirement, and draws me from
my seclusion to share his supper. What that is,
you well know; modest indeed, but neatly served,
and made grateful by the charm of his converse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
But be you my guest. The meal shall be as good,
and the wine better.”‘</p>

<p>‘How very philosophic!’ said Lamia. ‘So
much so, that the passage was probably written on
the morrow of a certain fascinating young woman,
whose name I cannot remember, but of whom
Politian, I have read, was, notwithstanding his
erudition, deeply enamoured, giving her hand to a
rival scholar, though which of them, I need scarcely
say, I have equally forgotten.’</p>

<p>‘The great Marullus, I think,’ said the Poet;
‘and your fascinating young woman was Alessandra,
the accomplished daughter of Lorenzo’s
Chancellor, Bartolomeo della Scala, whose house,
still standing, you must remind us to show you in
Florence.‘</p>

<div class="caption">A TUSCAN VILLA</div>
</div>

<p>Our first business was to make acquaintance
with the immediate surroundings of the home provided
for us by Veronica’s indefatigable foresight,
operating through a protracted correspondence
none of us had been deemed worthy to peruse.
The rural architecture of Tuscany is of a noble
simplicity; and, in the main portion of our villa,
built in the course of the sixteenth century, there
was no deviation from the familiar type. But,
adjoining it westward, and seemingly of more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
ancient date, were an upper and a lower <i lang="it">loggia</i> of
conventual aspect; the upper one having a sloping
roof of rich red tiles supported by graceful
pillars of <i lang="it">pietra serena</i>, and the lower one serving
as an Italian equivalent of an English verandah,
only more spacious and more tasteful, in which we
could sun or shade ourselves according to the
mood of the weather. Together, they formed an
impenetrable barrier against the well-known keenness
of the <i lang="it">tramontana</i>, while the main building
provided ample shelter against possible inclemency
from the east. To the west our view was over
the final valley of the Arno, that spacious plain of
fertile cultivation tenderly protected by hills of
exquisite shape and moderate elevation, on whose
bolder ridges stand historic towns of unmatched
picturesqueness; while southward, over vineyards
and olive-groves terraced down precipitously-sloping
ground, we gazed on the domes and towers
of the fair Tuscan capital. If one lives on the side
of a hill, one cannot reasonably expect to have a
very vast level expanse for the purposes of a
garden. A quadrangular space of modest dimensions
between the house and the low boundary wall,
where the ground began to fall away, was all that
had been dedicated to that pleasurable end; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
this afforded Lamia an opportunity of observing
that two such enthusiastic horticulturists as the
Poet and myself would find but few worlds to
conquer in so narrow a territory.</p>

<p>‘Forget,’ I ventured to plead, ‘what it is useless
to remember. England is well enough, and so is
Italy, but only on condition that you do not ask
from the one what belongs to the other. I am
not quite sure that the person who is intimately
acquainted with both is ever quite satisfied with
either, since it is part of our perverse human
nature mentally to extol what we have not, to the
depreciation of what we have.’</p>

<p>‘Is it to a woman you say that?’ observed
Lamia, to my complete confusion. ‘Men preach
Philosophy, women practise it; and I shall probably
show myself quite content without your
well-filled borders, while you inwardly, and
perhaps sometimes outwardly, long for your
rampant greenery and untidy efflorescence.
These <i lang="it">garofani</i>—you see,’ she said, turning to
the Poet, ‘I know the Italian for carnations,—in
their tasteful pots along the loopholed wall are
much more to my taste than all the straggling
annuals and robust perpetuals in the world.’</p>

<p>‘I can see,’ he said, kindly coming to my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
rescue, ‘you have found your proper home at last.
I thought it would be so; and we can only congratulate
ourselves on the result. But now let us
explore farther afield, and we shall probably find
that, if we will only use the word garden in a
liberal sense, and indeed in that in which it is used
in the corner of England where we have our home,
there is more of it than we have just rashly
assumed.’</p>

<p>Thereupon, we passed through a cool, spacious
<i lang="it">cortile</i>, cloistered on two of its sides, but for the
rest open to the sky, and whose only occupants
were a disused fountain and a tall glistening orange-tree
covered with golden fruit, of course of the hardy
bitter sort; thence under an archway festooned
with wistaria not yet in flower, and out into the
<i lang="it">podere</i>, which I must needs call by that name, since
there is no English equivalent for it, and which is
nowhere to be seen in such perfection as in
Tuscany.</p>

<p>‘Indeed, indeed you are right,’ exclaimed
Lamia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span> ‘right as when you once said that, were
it always Spring, one would never garden, even
in England. O this young green corn, with its
purple anemones, its crimson tulips, its pale almond
and intensely bright peach blossom, its fantastically
growing fig-trees with their budding tips, its burgeoning
vines and spectral olive-trees, all dwelling
together on the fair hillside that seems to be
smiling self-complacently at its own loveliness!
Look at that bank of irises, not yet broken from
their sheath! But when they have, what a sight
they will be!’</p>

<p>It is always delightful to have one’s feelings
expressed by some one else in language of enthusiasm
one might oneself be afraid to employ; and we
accompanied Lamia, as a sort of chorus, echoing
all she said, and only too well pleased to follow in
her footsteps, as she wandered on and on through
a world of beauty wholly new to her.</p>

<p>‘And these lovely grassy paths,’ she said, ‘that
lead everywhere and nowhere, tempting one to
travel on in search of something unknown, but
with ever, on either side, more sprouting wheat,
more pendent vines, more crookedly-branching
fig-stems, more tulips, more windflowers, more
mountains, more glimpses of towers and belfries in
the glittering distance. In England everything
seems to crouch. Here everything seems to
soar.’</p>

<p>Lured onward by Lamia’s enjoyment, and
mounting by such easy and gradual slopes that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
hardly noticed we were ascending, we suddenly
came to a grassy plateau almost encircled by secular
cypresses that are the distinctive glory of Tuscany;
and here we might have been tempted to halt, had
it not been that yet beyond it were rugged paths
that zigzagged among tall, dense bushes of white
heath and yellow broom, both now in full flower;
while on shapeless boulders and protruding rocks
were the stars of the white, the yellow, and the
rose-coloured cistus. Here and there we came on
sheets of the single pink anemone; elsewhere, in
the more sheltered nooks, were the Apennine wind-flower
which, with due care and choice of position,
perhaps you remember, we have persuaded to
flourish in the garden that we love.</p>

<p>‘As Veronica has told us that we are to lead
a life of strict simplicity,’ said Lamia, ‘we had
better do something to make it graceful; and, if
you two will only cut some branches of heath and
broom, I will be equally energetic among the
anemones.’</p>

<p>We were descending homeward with our lovely
spoil, when we heard a creaking sound well known
to me; and, in another moment, we overtook the
slowly-rolling wheels of a wooden wain—of wood,
not only in its low, long body, but of wood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
throughout, with wooden wheels, wooden pole,
and wooden yoke—drawn by a couple of cream-coloured
steers, and bearing a fragrant load of
newly-cut rye-grass. Though at no little inconvenience
and delay, on the incline along which it was
moving, the peasants who accompanied it at once
cried a halt, that they might show their respect to
and make the acquaintance of the new-comers.
Of the manifold charms of Tuscany, perhaps there
is none so great or so enduring as the charm
of manner peculiar to its rural population. Frank
without being free, deferential but never servile,
not without a fine reserve yet with never a touch
of shyness, withholding not a certain tribute
to social superiority, while tacitly intimating the
fundamental equality that appertains to human
brotherhood, the demeanour and speech of Tuscan
<i lang="it">contadini</i> keep intercourse perpetually fresh, and
impart to conversation on the tritest and most
familiar themes perennial liveliness and interest.
Their salutations, frequent though these be, for
they would never think of passing you without
one, are divested of conventionality by their manifest
sincerity. They can never see you, never
speak to you, too often; and, whenever they speak,
they smile. For thousands of years, morning has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
risen upon the world, but without any diminution
in its freshness; and it is the same with their <i lang="it">Buon
giorno, signore</i>! their <i lang="it">Felice sera, sua signoria</i>!
their <i lang="it">Felicissima notte, e buon riposo</i>! their <i lang="it">A
rivederla</i>! and all their ancient consecrated phrases
for conveying their sense of the strong link that
binds human creatures to each other. Every time
they say these things, they mean them; nor do
they ever tire of the iterated and reiterated courtesies
of life. The undeferential nod of Northern
manners, the mumbled recognition, the slipshod
salutation, would seem shocking to them, as
lacking in human piety. On this occasion, no
doubt, natural curiosity blended with native good-breeding
to make them halt in their labours; for
they were, I have no doubt, as eager to make our
acquaintance as we were to make theirs. Yet of
visible curiosity there was not a trace, as they lifted
their hats from their beaded foreheads and remained
bareheaded till we begged them to cover themselves.
What they conveyed was a fervour of welcome
akin to the glow of an Italian sun, a welcome that
warmed us through and through, and made us feel
that, at that instant, we were forming friendships
that, save for some fault of ours, would last through
life. Were we all in good health? Had we had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
a fatiguing journey? Were we comfortable and
happy in the villa? They hoped we were going
to stay a long time. Could they do anything for
us? Did we love Italy? Had we been there
before? O, but it was evident we had; for we
talked their language like one of themselves
(somewhat of an exaggeration, save in the case of
Veronica). Yes, the season was fairly forward,
and there was good promise for everything, given
what was now wanted, plenty of sunshine. Commonplaces,
you perhaps will say. Indeed, yes.
But which of us in this world is so surprisingly
original? The real originality, in some countries
I could mention, would be amiability, unfailing
courtesy in the ever-recurring trifles of life, a wish
to please and to be pleased, and a perpetual freshening
of existence by treating nothing in it as a
matter of course, or as undeserving of recognition
and thankfulness. Even the most original of us
are original only sometimes; and, if we are to consort
with each other at all, we must needs indulge
in a good deal of repetition and commonplace.
But freshness of manner can make repetition sound
absolutely new, and kindliness of disposition invest
the veriest commonplace with an air that everybody
shall take for uncommon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>It was with difficulty we led Lamia away from
her new acquaintances, not the least attractive of
those being the sleek, smooth-coated, soft-eyed
oxen that play so large a part in the picturesqueness
as in the rural life of Tuscany, and that seemed
to appreciate the tender stroking of her hand and
the equally soft caress of her voice.</p>

<p>‘I never felt such a bumpkin before,’ she said,
‘as in the presence of those gracious peasants.
What barbarians they must think us!’</p>

<p>‘If they thought that of you, Lamia,’ I said,
more struck by the exaggeration than by the
humility of her remark, ‘they certainly contrived
to conceal their impression. Still, speaking generally,
rural Tuscany is a school of manners.’</p>

<p>The noble simplicity referred to as the distinguishing
mark of villa architecture in Tuscany, is
as dominant in the interior as on the exterior of its
buildings; ample space being their chief feature and
adornment. Unless they have been invaded by
modern hands, they depend for effect on bold outlines
rather than on decorative detail; and they are
furnished in harmony with the same severe taste.
When Veronica admonished us that we were to lead
a life of strict simplicity, she referred to this
circumstance among others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>‘I hope,’ she said, ‘you have left your sybaritic
tastes at home. You will find many shapely but
no comfortable chairs, no superfluity of cushions,
nowhere a footstool, and, if you choose to lie on
what looks like a sofa, you will soon find you are
not reposing on rose-leaves. You must not come
to me and complain that there is not a bell in your
room, or, if there is, that it apparently has no
communication with the outer world. If Lamia
wishes to make a mess indoors with her flowers
and branches of blossom, she shall not be denied;
but you must not look for those more permanent
graces of life to which you are all so attached.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t mind <em>me</em>,‘ said Lamia. ‘I am quite
prepared to empty my own bath, brush my own
skirts, answer the bell instead of ringing it, and
live on <i lang="it">fagioli</i> and dried <i lang="it">funghi</i>. Indeed, it was
chiefly to indulge in those unusual luxuries that I
came to Italy.’</p>

<p>Considering who it is that has created, cherished,
and fostered in us those sybaritic tastes, and
that attachment to the graces and elegancies of life
of which Veronica spoke, and with which she told
us we were now to dispense, we may be pardoned,
I think, if, at the first opportunity, we indulged in
some private humour at her expense. If we are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
demoralised by domestic luxury, who is it but
Veronica that has corrupted us? I protest that
most men, in the matter of material comfort, are
absolute Spartans, and, as for the Poet, his native
austerity was once not to be surpassed, and he
still indulges from time to time in his ideal, at
any rate in conversation. But he too has, for the
most part, succumbed to Veronica’s unequalled
capacity for making life at once graceful and
commodious; and I am not sure that now he
would not, if at home, feel almost wronged if,
should he happen to want a paper-cutter, he had to
rise from his chair in order to go in search of one.</p>

<p>‘Just you wait!’ said Lamia, ‘and see what
becomes of the simple life to which we are to
dedicate ourselves. The first time Veronica goes
to Florence, she will return, I will engage to say,
laden with manifold conveniences of existence,
and by degrees she will introduce a world of things
into this splendid vacuum; and if, some fine
morning, you meet a plumber or bell-hanger on the
stairs, you need not regard him as an interloper.
Nor would I mind wagering my next quarter’s
dress-money that, before long, you will see me
sitting in the easiest of easy-chairs, and gracefully
reposing on the softest of ottomans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>.‘</p>

<p>‘I doubt it,’ said the Poet, ‘for Veronica has a
fine sense of the fitness of things, and her tastes
are sufficiently flexible for her to distinguish
between Northern and Southern needs, Northern
and Southern traditions. When Francesco Cibo,
the nephew of Innocent VIII., married Lorenzo’s
daughter, and came to Florence with a large and
splendid retinue, he was entertained during the
period of the nuptials with the utmost magnificence.
But, at the end of that time, he observed that all
the silver vessels and ornaments, of which there had
been such a profusion, disappeared from the table,
and were replaced by others of brass; and, moreover,
that every meal was now served with the utmost
plainness and frugality. Anxious lest his Roman
attendants should carry back to the Eternal City
the impression that he had contracted a union with
either a very poor or a very parsimonious family,
he sought to discover how they were faring, and
found they were still being entertained in the most
sumptuous manner. The enigma was explained
when Lorenzo said to him, “You are now one of
ourselves, and as one of ourselves I treat you.
My grandsire Cosimo used to say to his sons,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
‘Remember you are only citizens of Florence, and
must reserve what splendours you can command
for the glorification of the City.’ As his descendant,
I obey his injunction.”‘</p>

<p>‘Hark!’ I said. ‘Already there are sounds
of modern civilisation. The grass-plot is being
mown.’</p>

<p>Lamia and the Poet listened, though I think
the latter at once guessed my meaning.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ said Lamia. ‘A mowing-machine?
I cannot hear it. I hear only the
bleating of sheep.’</p>

<p>We passed afresh into the garden, and there
was a flock of ewes and lambs nibbling the sweet
short clover, attended by a picturesque shepherd
girl, who carefully kept them off the shrubs, but
went on industriously knitting all the while.</p>

<p>‘Is not that a simple enough mowing-machine
for you?’ I asked. ‘It attains to even Veronica’s
ideal of primitive expedients.‘</p>

<p>‘It is as simple and primitive,’ said Lamia, ‘as
much of the garden itself. What a comfort it is
to find oneself in a country where’—I imagine
this was intended as a shaft against myself—‘there
does not rage a fidgety mania for perfection.
Flowers here are reduced to their proper subordination
in the universe.’</p>

<p>Whether Lamia was right or wrong in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
conclusion, it must be allowed that, as a race,
Italians have not that tender attachment to flowers
which is universal among ourselves, and that being,
contrary to general belief, far less sentimental and
more practical than we are, they do not care to
devote much attention to the growing of anything
that cannot be taken to market and turned into
<i lang="it">quattrini</i>, or ready cash. Hence, they will willingly
grow carnations, freesias, arum-lilies, lilies of the
valley, ranunculuses, and such like flowers that
find a quick sale on the ledges of the <i lang="it">Palazzo
Strozzi</i>, or under the shadow of the <i lang="it">Municipio</i> in
the <i lang="it">Piazza della Trinità</i>. But even these are
so reared that the purchaser alone gets any
delectation out of them, and the spot where they
are produced is but little more of a garden in
consequence of their temporary presence. The
difficulty is to induce an Italian gardener to
believe that you care for flowers for their own
sake, that you regard the sale of them as a sort
of desecration, that you feel they ought to be
love-gifts, tokens of present or mementoes of
absent affection, and, in any case, cherished companions
of one’s private thoughts, one’s habitual
pursuits, and one’s transitory emotions. He cannot
understand that you want to consort with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
them, to tend them in sickness and health, to
cultivate them for better or for worse, to let them
twine and garland themselves about your inner
and your outer life, to make them, in fact, flesh
of your flesh, and spirit of your spirit, till death
do you part, when, with a sweet form of suttee,
they will come and immolate themselves upon
your grave.</p>

<p>This conflict of ideals between the Poet and
myself on the one side, and Ippolito, the gardener,
on the other,—for the humblest folk in Tuscany
have classical names, which they imagine to be
Christian, and indeed frequently are so, thanks to
some primitive martyr in the Church Calendar,—began
at once, and never wholly ceased. We put
our veto on the sale in Florence of flower or leaf
grown on the premises; and as Veronica, with all
her marvellous foresight, had not extended our
contract to these, we had to arrange with him what
was to be paid by us for what would otherwise
have been profitable produce. Ippolito’s calculations
were of the most elaborate character; but
their complexity arose solely from his scrupulous
desire to do justice as between man and man.
Personally, he had no money interest in the matter;
for, but for what he regarded as our unaccountable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
tastes, he would have carried all the saleable flowers
twice a week to that charming little market-place
which every visitor to the fair city knows so well,
made the best bargain he could with the purchasing
public, and credited his <i lang="it">padrone</i> with the amount
received. Selling the flowers, he could know, to a
<i lang="it">centesimo</i>, what they were worth. Not selling
them, in deference to these odd <i lang="it">forestieri</i>, and
therefore having to surmise what they would
probably have fetched could they have been sold,
and anxious neither to defraud his master nor to
rob us, he lived, during our sojourn, a life of
continual arithmetical anxiety. In vain were the
Poet’s magnificent endeavours to make him understand
that we were not, as modern language has
it, so mighty particular as to what we paid for
rescuing the flowers from what he regarded as an
ignoble doom. We could excite no sentimental
emotion on the subject in Ippolito. To him it was
simply a matter of addition in decimals, the sum
total of which should represent the practical results
of abstract justice. It must not be supposed,
however, that this quite satisfied him, or entirely
quieted his conscience. To the last he let us
perceive that he considered our arbitrary conduct
to have a certain moral obliquity about it, since it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
caused and consecrated so much absolute waste;
waste of time, waste of material, waste of money.
Once, when we were not present, he appealed to
Veronica, and asked if we were really in earnest in
forbidding him to sell any portion of the flowers.
The violets flowered by tens of thousands, the
carnations were rotting on their stalks, and it was
not possible more freesias could be wanted for
indoors; and, with his <i lang="it">Ma, Signora mia</i>, and
<i lang="it">Senta, Sua Signoria</i>, he did his best to convert her.
But she told him we were inexorable; and, though
she fully shared our sentiments on the subject, she
laughed at us for a couple of <i lang="it">zucconi</i>, or dunderheads,
for allowing ourselves to pay twice what the
flowers were worth: a form of judgment which, as
we have seen, was not quite equitable, but which
nevertheless represented, with tolerable accuracy,
the low estimate she entertained of either the
Poet’s or my capacity for a bargain.</p>

<div class="caption">A NOBLE FOUNTAIN</div>
</div>

<p>Once Ippolito was thoroughly convinced of our
obduracy concerning his mercenary traditions, he
showed an amiable readiness to please us, by bringing
pot after pot of well-grown plants from frame
and shelf and sheltering nook, and placing them
where we would, and mostly round the noble
fountain that flashed quietly but unceasingly in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
centre of the garden enclosure; though he well
knew that, even in the genial weather with which
we were being favoured, the length of their days
would thereby be somewhat curtailed; white arum-lilies,
freesias, lilies of the valley, and early
carnations, thus making a most lively show.</p>

<p>‘Do not suppose, though,’ I said to Lamia,
‘that Italy has not its true garden season, even in
the English sense; and I trust you will, in due
course, be able to judge of it for yourself. But it
is brief in its marvellous beauty. Like the people
themselves of this lovely land, the year ages soon,
when compared with the lagging Spring, the lingering
Summer, and the slowly-ripening Autumn of
Northern climes. But when the roses come they
will come in battalions, the wistaria will run riot
over wall and pergola, the <i>Spiræa Van Houtte</i> will
whitely decorate itself with a lavishness unknown
to chillier latitudes, and Madonna lilies will astound
you by their height, and irises by their profusion.
For a month, in a favourable season for six weeks,
one will be embowered in bloom; then suddenly to
find, if one gardens in English fashion, you have
no garden at all.’</p>

<p>‘A short life and a merry one,’ said Lamia:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
‘an ideal existence.’</p>

<p>‘But do not let us forget,’ I observed, ‘that
when this brief exuberant blending of Spring and
Summer has passed away from the garden, the
purple and opal bunches of the festooned and
trellised vine come timely to take its place.’</p>

<p>‘Nor,’ added the Poet, ‘should we omit that
bewitching preliminary to the profuse period you
speak of, when, as now, in whichever direction you
look or ramble in that astonishing valley, almond
and peach, plum-blossom, pear-blossom, and
apple-bloom, fleck with their rich rival tints, from
purest white to rosiest pink, the silvery spray of the
ubiquitous olives.’</p>

<p>‘Silvery till ruffled by the wind,’ he went on,
‘as Lorenzo so admirably describes it in his poem
on the <cite>Ambra</cite>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘L’uliva, in qualche dolce piaggia aprica,</div>
  <div class="verse">Secondo il vento par, or verde, or bianca.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘What an incautious quotation!’ said Lamia;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
‘and, were I a critic, I should at once fasten on
you a charge of gross plagiarism. I remember, if
you do not:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘The smiling slopes with olive groves bedecked,</div>
  <div class="verse">Now darkly green, now, as the breeze did stir,</div>

  <div class="verse">With elfin branches laced with gossamer;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse">And then so faint, the eye could scarce detect</div>
  <div class="verse">Which the gray hillside, which the foliage fair;</div>
  <div class="verse">Until once more it dense and sombre grew,</div>
  <div class="verse">To shift again just as the zephyr blew.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Have I not established my case?’</p>

<p>‘Completely, my dear Lamia; and I am glad
to find myself in such excellent company as that of
Lorenzo, more especially now that we have taken
possession of a villa where he must often have
been a guest, with Politian for host, and Poggio
and Pico della Mirandola for companions.‘
‘I fear,’ said Lamia modestly, ‘I should have
found them too learned to be congenial society.’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill10"></a>
<img src="images/i_141.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">PEACH, PLUM, AND PEAR-BLOSSOM</div>
</div>

<p>‘Not when Lorenzo was with them; for he
assimilated their learning to life, and contrived to
make gaiety out of their scholarship. With more
even than the statesmanship of his grandfather,
and of whom it may equally be said that he ruled
without arms and without a title, endowed with
no inconsiderable portion of the culture of the
students he so generously abetted, Lorenzo was a
thorough man-of-the-world, and more than a
respectable man-of-letters. I recommend to you
his description, in the <cite>Selve d’ Amore</cite>, of the
shepherd leading his flock from the wintry fold to
the Spring pasture, and carrying in his arms a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
newly-dropped lamb, his sonnet on the origin of
the violet, and, still more perhaps, the one in praise
of rural sights, sounds, and solitude. Permit me
to cite at least a portion of it:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Cerchi, chi vuol, le pompe, e gli alti onori,</div>
  <div class="verse">Le piazze, e tempi, e gli edifizi magni,</div>
  <div class="verse">Le delicie, il tesor, qual accompagni</div>
  <div class="verse">Mille duri pensier, mille dolori.</div>
  <div class="verse">Un verde praticel pien di bei fiori,</div>
  <div class="verse">Un rivolo che l’erba intorno bagni,</div>
  <div class="verse">Un augelletto che d’amor si lagni,</div>
  <div class="verse">Acqueta molto meglio i nostri ardori.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘I fear,’ said Lamia, ‘I have not yet made
sufficient progress in my studies to follow your
recitation completely. Will you kindly translate?’</p>

<p>‘Let a spontaneous paraphrase suffice, which
will reproduce the original with, if with less
literary perhaps with more spiritual, accuracy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Covet who will the patronage of Kings,</div>
  <div class="verse">And pompous titles Emperors bestow,</div>
  <div class="verse">Splendour, and revelry, and all that brings</div>
  <div class="verse">A thousand bitter thoughts, a world of woe:</div>
  <div class="verse">A meadow glistening in an April shower,</div>
  <div class="verse">A green-banked rivulet, and, near his nest,</div>
  <div class="verse">A blackbird carolling in guelder bower,</div>
  <div class="verse">‘Tis these that soothe and satisfy the breast.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘Surely it is strange,’ I said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> ‘that a man so
occupied with affairs of State as Lorenzo, conspiring
and conspired against from morning to night,
a landowner not indifferent to the prosperity of his
estate, a banker attentive to the profitable employment
of his capital, a father most anxious for the
wise bringing up of his sons, a collector of manuscripts,
gems and intaglios, a founder of libraries,
an owner of alum mines, a prince, a statesman, and
a diplomatist, should not only have experienced
such a sentiment as you have cited, but should
have found leisure to give expression to it.’</p>

<p>‘And in so short a space of time,’ said Lamia,
more indulgent than usual to my observations.
‘Was he not only forty-one when he died?’</p>

<p>‘He was,’ I said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span> ‘but he seems to have lived
every hour of his life, and to have acted on the
principle he lays down in his contribution to the
<cite>Disputationes Camaldulenses</cite>, that life should consist
in equal parts of action and contemplation; thereby
being rather at issue with Plato, whom he loved
so well. But even in his most contemplative
moods he never seems to be divorced from the
themes that interest mankind. There is a passage
in a poem of his expository of the Platonic Philosophy
which some critics have thought gave
Michelangelo the suggestion for his famous marble
<i>Sonno</i>, which you will shortly see in the Sacristy of
San Lorenzo; while, in his <cite>Simposio</cite> there is a
description of a toping friar which is worthy of
Chaucer, and in the <cite>Canzoni a Ballo</cite> and the
<cite>Canti Carnascialeschi</cite>, which I cannot recommend
you to read save in what you will scarcely find, an
expurgated edition, he expresses the very thoughts,
feelings, and ideals of the populace of Florence.’</p>

<p>‘Veronica shall be my Bowdler,’ said Lamia,
‘and meanwhile I thank you for your erudition!
But, as it happens to be my birthday, do you
think you could forget the Medici for a few
moments, if only to wish me, in the most conventional
manner, “many happy returns”?‘</p>

<p>I had not forgotten the circumstance, and indeed
had armed myself with a propitiatory gift which I
intended to offer later in the day. But, before I
could stammer out my excuses, she put her hand
in that of the Poet, and said:</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you have forgotten that, not very
long ago, you rebuked me most gently for one of
my numerous foibles, and that I asked you to tell
me what I ought to do, and to be, in order to
merit your approval. Will you, for a birthday
present, tell me now?’</p>

<p>We had come, in our saunterings, to the long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
low wall, leaning over which we gazed down direct
on Florence.</p>

<p>‘With pleasure,’ he said, ‘and I must only
hope you will not think me too severe.</p>

<p>O these poets! I need scarcely say that, after
this insidious effusion, I stowed away the present
I had intended for Lamia in a secret drawer,
reserving it for some more propitious occasion.
I hope I am not prejudiced when I say that the
verses were scarcely among the Poet’s happier compositions.
But diamonds would have lacked lustre,
after such metrical adulation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But did you go all that way, it will perhaps be
asked, and introduce Lamia to the acknowledged
fascinations of Tuscany, only to wander in search
of wild-flowers, to climb rural hill-sides, to rave
about scenery and sunshine, to listen reverentially
to the Poet’s rhymes, and to discuss things in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
general, and Lamia’s favourite themes in particular?
Surely, you may be disposed to add, all those things
could have been done just as well at home. Had
Florence itself, its churches, its palaces, its galleries,
its storied thoroughfares, no attraction for you all?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill11"></a>
<img src="images/i_149.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FLORENCE</div>
</div>

<p>Indeed they had. But these have been written
about with such minuteness by the learned, and
with such fervour by the enthusiastic, that you
would hardly thank so homely a pen as mine for
describing them afresh. Moreover, let it be confessed
that we had a way of our own, which is
hardly the common way, of impressing Lamia’s
sensitive mind with the artistic marvels of the City
of Flowers. To the rest of us, Florence was
already as familiar even as the Garden that we love,
and the Poet had a theory, in which I entirely concurred,
as to how Lamia’s familiarity should grow
to be like ours, with a reserved freshness of its
own. ‘There are two ways,’ he said, ‘of
approaching a place like Florence. You can try
to take possession of it, or you can allow it to take
possession of you. The first is the more usual,
but the second is, I would suggest, the more
excellent way. Once when I was travelling hitherward,
I remember an American tourist who was
the only other occupant of the railway compartment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
asking me if I knew Pisa; and, on my replying
that I did, he said he should be much obliged if I
would point it out to him. Shortly we approached
it, and the train slackened pace in order to make
the customary halt of some seven or eight
minutes. “This is Pisa,” I said, and he at once
leaned out of the window, and there he remained
intently gazing till its Duomo, Leaning Tower,
and Baptistery, could be seen no more. Then
he turned to me, and said, “I thank you, sir, for
showing me Pisa. I should not have liked to
return to the States without having seen Pisa.”
I beg of you not to take my fellow-traveller as a
national type, for Americans are as various, and
differ from each other as much, as the people of
other countries. But I cannot think he had seen
Pisa. Yet numbers of people resemble him in
their tacit assumption that a hasty visual impression
or snapshot, so to speak, deserves to be
described as seeing, though, assuredly, where great
works of art are concerned, it is not to see with
the mind’s eye, to say nothing of the spirit’s.‘</p>

<p>‘I am easily taken possession of, as you know,’
said Lamia, for a moment pointedly turning to me,
who certainly know nothing of the kind, and
indeed know very much the reverse, and then re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>directing
her attention to the Poet. ‘But, if one
is to be taken possession of by all the lovely places
and things in this world, would not one have to
live to a rather venerable age?’</p>

<p>‘There is an alternative,’ I said, ‘is there not?
which is to be taken possession of by only some
of them, but to be taken possession of by these
thoroughly.’</p>

<p>‘How conjugal and domestic that sounds.
But it makes no allowance for feminine curiosity.
I should be sorry, when we leave Florence, to think
there was anything in it worth seeing I had not
seen.‘
‘Neither shall there be, I hope,’ said the Poet,
‘but, if one is really to see what is worth seeing, I
think one must bridle one’s curiosity a little about
much that is not worth seeing. The specialist, no
doubt, must be boundlessly curious concerning his
particular pursuit, and the professional student
of Art is a specialist. We are, at best, only
dilettanti, and seek solely to expand our minds
through sympathetic and discriminating enjoyment.‘</p>

<p>‘In fact,’ said Lamia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> ‘it is with Art as with
Life. If one is to enjoy it, one must not know
too much about it. In that case, I can promise
myself, during the next few weeks, no end of
pleasure.’</p>

<p>We none of us, unless it be Veronica sometimes,
resent Lamia’s seemingly irrelevant way of diverting
a discussion, and the Poet has less reason than
any of us to do so, since she not only accepts his
utterances as words of absolute wisdom, but invariably
strives to shape herself according to his
canons of life and conduct. Accordingly, when we
descended into Florence, which was pretty often,
she manifested neither impatience nor curiosity,
but suffered herself to fall into the fortuitous
fashion of wandering about it that he recommended.
We had neither guide nor guide-book; and, if any
of us showed a disposition to enter here or to linger
there, we entered or lingered as a matter of course.
Lamia was left to her own impulses in giving
much or little attention to tomb, fresco, statue,
altar-piece, pulpit, or doorway; nor was she distracted
by any information concerning them till
she asked for it. Then, indeed, it was given most
willingly, and it was rarely that one or other of us
could not answer her inquiries. The Poet and I
were sometimes at fault, but Veronica never. If
you think that by such a method as this much
must have been overlooked that is well deserving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of notice, you must remember there was nothing to
prevent us from returning to the same chapel or
sacristy, the same monument or bas-relief, again
and again; and, so varying is the human mood in
general, and Lamia’s mood in particular, that what
she would pass by on one occasion would wholly
engross her attention in another. Thus there
was a certain method underlying our apparent
purposelessness, and I fancy she ended by knowing
fully as much about Florence as those who order
their visits to its innumerable treasures, while I am
sure she enjoyed herself infinitely more. Moreover,
this unsystematic system of artistic vagrancy issued
sometimes in welcome surprises that extended the
experience of all of us. One evening, for instance,
just as we were on the point of quitting the city
and driving homeward, Lamia said:</p>

<p>‘Let us go into the Duomo for a few minutes.’</p>

<p>‘But it is so dark,’ I suggested, ‘you will see
nothing!’</p>

<p>We entered, nevertheless. It was the eve of
Good Friday, when, according to the Roman
Catholic Ritual, the Host, instead of being
enshrined as usual on the High Altar, is, in commemoration
of the sacred tragedy of Calvary,
borne to a dimly-lighted Sepulchre, where, all night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
long, the faithful come to watch and pray. The
Office of <i lang="la">Tenebræ</i> was just over, and the worshippers
had all passed out of the Cathedral. There
remained in the doubtful light only a Verger and
ourselves, till, from either side of the Choir, there
emerged a figure robed in black, and bearing a
lighted torch. Slowly, solemnly, and parallel to
each other, they skirted the inner walls of the
building, till they met at the main doorway, and
then, at the same grave pace, they walked up
the long empty nave. I had a surmise of what
was signified by this slow and lonely procession,
but in order to be quite sure I said to the
Verger:</p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Cosa fanno?</i>’ (What are they doing?)</p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Cercano Il Signore, e non lo trovano</i>,’ he replied.
(They are looking for Our Lord, and cannot find
Him.)</p>

<p>We all had heard the reply. Then we quitted
the Duomo, and drove home in silence.</p>

<p>Surely it is true, is it not, that accidental
experiences have a sharper savour and leave behind
them a more enduring reminiscence than projected
ones? What one expects but rarely comes up to
expectation, and has generally cost some thought
or trouble to procure. What happens unex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>pectedly,
if it be of the welcome kind, finds one
disarmed and indisposed to criticise, and the
emotion it excites is all sheer gain, no price of
admission, to so speak, having been paid for it.
Just as wandering along a river is more agreeable
than walking along a canal, so people who canalise
their lives and prearrange their enjoyments lose
much of the enchantment which attends the guiding
beneficence of chance. In Florence, you can
scarcely halt anywhere, but story sacred or profane,
saint or scholar, painter or patriot, poet, martyr,
or enthusiast, has left some indelible trace to mark
and glorify the spot, and to make you lift your
head and then your heart. The very lapidary
inscriptions let into the walls where architect or
sculptor, jurist or astronomer once abode, are a
continual invitation to the wayfarer to pause, to
read, to ponder. Nor is it perhaps the most
famous or the best known that are the most
interesting and suggestive. The Poet seemed to
have a special faculty for arresting our footsteps
by those most worthy of contemplation. ‘Is not
this one,’ he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span> ‘peculiarly consolatory in a
period like the present, when most people, and the
Italians especially, seem to think that originality
consists in artificial novelty and even grotesqueness—for
that is where such novelty too often leads—of
manner and expression.’</p>

<p>Thereupon he read: ‘<i lang="it">Qui visse e morì Benedetto
da Majano, chi nelle opere sue confrontò con
venustà di stile e di forme le grandi idee del genio
creatore.</i>’ (Here lived and died Benedetto da
Maiano, who in his works conferred charm of style
and beauty of form on the lofty ideas of creative
genius.)</p>

<p>‘To do that,’ he said, ‘is to overcome the
main difficulty and solve the essential problem of
Art, whether in marble or in language. In our
day, too many persons shirk the difficulty and
ignore the problem, and seek to conceal the
poverty of their ideas under the extravagance of
their manner.’</p>

<p>‘Some of these are very successful,’ I ventured
to observe.</p>

<p>‘Not,’ said Veronica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span> ‘if in the notion of
success be included that of succession. Congratulated
to-day, will they not be consigned to
oblivion to-morrow, when right taste has resumed
its authority, or when some one yet more extravagant
creates an impression, equally sudden
and equally transitory, of a somewhat similar
character?’</p>

<p>‘I think so,’ said the Poet, ‘and I am sufficiently
enamoured of <i lang="it">venustà di stile</i> to hope so. As
great a master of style as this century has produced
says somewhere, “<i lang="fr">On peut tout dire dans le style
simple et correct des bons auteurs. Les expressions
violentes viennent toujours ou d’une prétention, ou
de l’ignorance de nos richesses réelles.</i>” Do you
mind, Lamia, committing that sentence to memory,
for I see you sometimes deeply immersed in works
of much pretension, but consisting for the most
part of <i lang="it">expressions violentes</i>, though I never observe
you admiring in marble or on canvas the violence
or the profuse colouring you occasionally tolerate in
language?‘</p>

<p>‘Is it not,’ said Veronica, ‘that in architecture,
painting, and sculpture, the manner in which a
thing is done is so much more conspicuous, so to
speak, than what is done, that failure, whether it
arise from feebleness or from violence, strikes us at
once; whereas, in language, what is said, if interesting
in itself, makes us indulgent to, and indeed
forgetful of, the manner of saying it?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose that is so,’ he answered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span> ‘and
perhaps it is one of the incidental drawbacks to
literature. Fortunately, however, what you say is
more true of prose than of verse; defect of style
in poetry being at least as obvious to fastidious
readers as in marble. And yet,’ he added, ‘in our
time, a grotesque, violent, and what seems to me
lamentable way of saying things has been more
than tolerated in verse, for the sake of the things
said. For my part, I should be sorry to be original,
either in prose or verse, at the expense of truth or
beauty.’</p>

<div class="caption">ROSES AND IRIS</div>
</div>

<p>The absence of method in our visits to cloister
or gallery seemed to govern most of our movements.
Sometimes we were but two, sometimes
but three, of a company; and it would happen
that, when we were four, we lost touch of each
other for a time, and went our separate ways.
Veronica not infrequently was missing; and generally,
when this occurred, when she returned alone
to the villa, she brought with her some ‘object of
antiquity,’ as the Florentine dealers in curios and
old furniture call such things, purchased after
considerable thought and much bargaining. I
think you know Veronica has a large heart, and
would defraud no one of his due, and indeed would
give any one more than his due, where no bargaining
was in question. But she knows just as
much about the date and value of <i lang="it">cassettone</i>, triptych,
or embroidery, as any of the various dealers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
on the Ponte Vecchio or in the Via de’ Serragli;
and she not unnaturally enjoyed displaying her
peculiar learning in those interesting haunts. Her
perfect familiarity with the language, and indeed
even with Florentine <i lang="fr">patois</i>, added to her advantage
and strengthened her position in appraising the
value of mediæval picture-frame or sixteenth-century
mirror. Moreover, it is the greatest
possible error to suppose that Florentine dealers
are consumed with a single-minded desire to rob
unwary purchasers; and I am convinced they much
preferred to conclude a fair bargain with Veronica,
than an unfair one with the first ignorant comer.
Oriental ways and traditions of business still linger
sufficiently with them to make <i lang="it">prezzo fisso</i> or a
rigidly-fixed price exceedingly distasteful. Their
day is long, they have abundance of time on their
hands, and, if the few things they sell in the course
of the week were sold without demur and in a
couple of minutes, life would be insufferably tedious
for want of human intercourse and agreeable conversation.
Veronica invariably regaled us with
minute accounts, on the occasion of each fresh
purchase, of the polite but protracted controversy
that had attended it; and very diverting these
were. She preferred to conduct these transactions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
without our company; for, in the first place, as
she truly enough remarked, we knew nothing
whatever upon the subject and could therefore be
of no use to her, and, in the second place, when we
honoured her with our useless society, one or
other of us invariably ended by showing signs of
impatience, and to be impatient over a bargain
is inevitably to get the worst of it. She did
not always come off a winner in these friendly
encounters; and she was just as candid and as
diverting in confessing her defeats as in recording
her victories. On one occasion she suffered a
peculiarly humiliating disaster, which she detailed
with much zest at her own expense. Wishing to
give an agreeable surprise to Lamia on the occasion
of that Birthday, when, as you will perhaps remember,
I was so sorely discomfited, she went in search
of some amber beads which Lamia had more than
once expressed a longing to find in order to complete
a set she already possessed. But it was
indispensable they should be of a special hue. At
length, Veronica discovered some in a shop in the
Por Santa Maria, but, do what she would, and
notwithstanding all her Florentine wit, she could
not bring the owner of them into what she deemed
a reasonable frame of mind as regards price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Ebbene</i>,’ she said, ‘I will try elsewhere,’</p>

<p>She tried everywhere, but in vain, and so at
length had to go back to the Por Santa Maria, and
say she would take the beads at the man’s own
price.</p>

<p>‘But now, <i lang="it">Signora mia</i>,’ he said, ‘that is no
longer the price: you can find no others in
Florence to suit you, so these in the meantime
have become more valuable.’ And he added some
insignificant sum to the original figure, more for
the sake of triumph than from any mercenary
motive. Had Veronica been making a purchase
for herself, I am sure she would have defrauded
him of his victory by leaving him in possession pf
his amber treasures. But she would not disappoint
Lamia, and so paid the forfeit of her unsuccessful
strategy.</p>

<p>But we had a less humorous and far more
touching experience on another occasion. Visiting
a hillside village some twenty-five miles away,
we were all much taken by a small altar-piece, a
<i>Presentation in the Temple</i>, which stood in a
side-chapel in a little church of otherwise no
particular pretension. We discussed, then and
there, by whom it may have been painted, for I
need scarcely say that, on that subject, we all, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
so many other people, consider ourselves exceedingly
expert, and quite competent to express an
opinion. The <i lang="it">Parroco</i>, a venerable Priest of
courtly manners but much humility, did not affect
to adjudicate among us, but was evidently much
interested in our deliberations, and still more in
our admiration of the picture. At last he hesitatingly
asked Veronica if we should like to become
the owners of it. This had certainly not occurred
to us, and we were rather taken aback by the
question. But Veronica, enchanted at the chance
of an unexpected bit of bargaining, said ‘Yes,’
without a moment’s hesitation. So modest a sum,
however, was asked, if compared with the high
artistic qualities we had been attributing to it, that
it went against her conscience, which, as you know,
is the strongest part of her, to offer anything less.
Moreover, she probably remembered, on second
thoughts, that the place was not a suitable one for
financial transactions; and any remaining scruple
we might have had in completing the bargain was
set at rest by his telling us that he had long been
anxious to buy a second-hand harmonium that was
for sale, whereby the services of his little church
could be conducted in a more seemly manner.</p>

<p>The picture was carried off; and, by the time it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
had been in our possession forty-eight hours, its
artistic value had enormously increased, and there
was hardly any Umbrian painter, Raphael perhaps
excepted, to whom we were not ready to ascribe
it. We discussed, over and over again, where it
should be hung when we returned to England,
and first one position of honour and then another
was suggested for it. But, as I knew well enough
from the first would turn out to be the case,
it was finally assigned by Veronica to the Poet’s
study.</p>

<p>For a week she had the satisfaction of seeing
all of us as much interested in, and as proud of, a
purchase as herself. But, on the morning of the
eighth day after our mountain excursion, the old
Priest suddenly made his appearance at the villa,
whither he had walked all the way; and, in a state
of much agitation, he said that he had come to ask
us to give him back the picture, the price of which
he would restore and which he had in his hand.
At first there was a protesting chorus, and Veronica
was particularly eloquent in pointing out that the
request was most unreasonable, as we had given
the full amount asked for, without any demur.
Thereupon the poor old man explained, with tears
in his eyes, that his parishioners had missed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
picture, and, though he had told them of his
intended purchase of the harmonium, they insisted
on its being restored to its traditional home, and
all his pleas and arguments had proved unavailing
with them. To such an appeal but one answer
was possible. The picture was returned, and the
Poet’s study will never see that Umbrian masterpiece.
Our disappointment was great; but why,
said Veronica, should everybody be disappointed?
Poor old man! He stood there a most touching
figure. So we put our hearts and purses together;
and the sound of the second-hand harmonium now
follows on his quavering voice, when, in answer
to his <i lang="la">Dominus vobiscum</i>, the entire mountain congregation
shrills out, to its instrumental accompaniment,
<i lang="la">Et cum spiritu tuo</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, Veronica’s purchases, over
and above being definitive, were as useful as they
were ornamental; and it sometimes seemed as
though Lamia’s predictions concerning the transformation
that was gradually to come over the
villa were about to be fulfilled. Veronica invariably
declared that the furniture she brought back
with her from the Via Maggio, or the Piazza Santa
Maria Novella, was intended strictly for home
consumption, and would in due course be packed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and dispatched to England. Where she would
find room in a house already remarkably well
stocked, was a mystery to all of us; and meanwhile
it remained on the spot, to whose aspect it certainly
added finish and charm, and to whose commodiousness
it materially contributed.</p>

<p>‘I told you,’ said Lamia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> ‘I should end by
having a comfortable armchair, and you see I have.
Nor can I well doubt that a host of work-people
have been secretly introduced by Veronica,
for I can now count on my bell ringing with
absolute certainty; and, as for Placida and Perfetta,’—Placida
and Perfetta were two handmaidens,—‘though
they still regard fair words and sweet
smiles as the principal ingredients of domestic
service, they have developed a talent for tidying
my drawers and arranging my toilet-table which
cannot but have proceeded from severe drilling by
Veronica, while you and I were discussing the Infinite
under the shade of cheerful boughs. Shortly after
we first came, Veronica gave one of our dear devoted
but somewhat primitive attendants a sponge, for
what purpose I cannot say. But this domestic
novelty was found so useful, that each of them in
turn, she discovered, had the loan of it, till it came
to enjoy an absolute monopoly in the cleaning of
the establishment. Now, I believe, sponges, and all
other requisites of a well-ordered place of residence,
are as plentiful as blackberries. Do you remember,’
she said, turning to me, ‘your giving me some
most lovely flowers last week, which, of course, I
treasured beyond words, even after they had faded?
But I discovered, the next morning, that Perfetta,
moved by a spirit of economy which seems to be
a perfect passion with these dear people, was applying
them, on the carpet, to the same purpose, I
am told, for which we sometimes use tea-leaves in
England. That was a sad ending, was it not, to
your lovely gift?’</p>

<p>Lamia’s observation on ‘the principal ingredients
of domestic service,’ as understood in Italy by those
who render it, was strictly accurate. They wait
on you with a smile, and minister to your need
with copious conversation. They will end by
giving you all you ask for; but you must ask,
and you must not expect that, having asked for it
ninety-nine times, you will get it the hundredth,
without asking for it again. That would be to
defraud them, and you as well, of an opportunity
of talk, the thing they love most in the world.
Moreover, they have an invincible objection to
being made methodical; nor can you give them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
greater pleasure than to ask them to do the work
naturally pertaining to somebody else. The cook
would be delighted to nurse the baby, the housemaid
would find it quite natural to be bidden to
cook the dinner, the butler would eagerly go in
search of the vegetables, and the gardener at once
mount the box and drive you into Florence.
Only do not ask them to be perfect, according to
English ideas, in their own line. They will do
anything on earth for you, if you go the right way
about it; but they will not be turned into machines.
Nothing I have ever seen in Veronica is more
admirable, or shows so conclusively the discrimination
she can blend with her love of order, than the
amount of method, limited no doubt but quite
unusual, with which, for the time at least, she
imbued those about us; and Lamia, as we have
seen, indulged in a little characteristic raillery on
the subject.</p>

<p>‘It is all very well,’ said the Poet, ‘for us to
have our little joke about a certain person’s passion
for discipline. But, upon my word, what Italy
stands in need of is a Ruler with plenary powers,
of the temperament and talents of Veronica. So
the Roman Empire was founded, so the British.
Dear Lamia, you are very charming; our friend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
here is, I do not forget, a gardener of much repute,
and I write verses which, I am told, sometimes
give pleasure to people who are easily pleased.
But Veronica is worth all of us put together a
hundred times over.‘</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ said Lamia. ‘Veronica is our
<i lang="la">Minerva Medica</i>, whose salutary if sometimes
unpalatable wisdom keeps us in such tolerable
health as moral valetudinarians like myself are
capable of; whereas I am but a would-be Egeria,
who have not yet succeeded in inducing any one,
and you, dear Poet, least of all, to be my Numa.
Still, do not judge me altogether by the way in
which I conduct myself here, among a people very
much after my own heart. I <em>have</em> a conscience,
which I showed by declaring it at the frontier, as
I heard it was contraband. I proved to be right;
it was confiscated, and I have got on very comfortably
without it ever since. Indeed, I should have
missed a new gown much more. Poets, we all
know, never have a conscience, in any country.
But, as Veronica has enough for two, indeed—obligingly
remembering my existence—for three, I
daresay we shall continue to manage fairly well in
this easy-going land, with Veronica’s occasional
assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>.‘</p>

<p>At this moment, Veronica joined us under the
lower <i lang="it">loggia</i>, where we had for some time been
sitting, and desisting more frequently than perhaps
you have imagined, from audible converse, in
order to commune silently with the plashing of the
fountain in front of us, with city, plain, and river
far below, and with hill-slope and summit everywhere
around us. The sun had just disappeared;
and, each instant, mountain and sky grew more and
more unreal, more and more transfigured in the
afterglow. The last <i lang="la">Ave Maria</i> bell had rung;
the last wain drawn by the sleek, swaying oxen
had creaked up the hill; and, somewhere among
the more distant olives, a peasant lingering at his
work, but pondering aloud on his love, sang out
with clear voice to the clear air:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Fin al fin de’ giorni miei,</div>
  <div class="verse">Io te sola voglio amar.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘You never told us,’ said Veronica, ‘what you
two did yesterday afternoon.’ The two were the
Poet and Lamia.</p>

<p>‘You scarcely gave us the chance,’ Lamia
replied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span> ‘We were all so absorbed in admiring the
bust you brought from Florence of the founder
of the Magliabecchian Library, whose name I have
already forgotten, but who was himself, you told
us, what you, dear Veronica, will become if you
go on accumulating stray black-letter volumes
at the rate you are doing at present,—<i lang="la">quædam
bibliotheca</i>. But have a care. What if they were
lost or stolen? I was reading only yesterday
that, when Guarino, returning to Florence from
Constantinople with a cargo of Greek manuscripts,
was shipwrecked, and all his treasures went to the
bottom of the sea, his hair turned white. See
how well-informed I am getting. I can tell you
still more on this interesting subject, and indeed
meditate lecturing on it next winter in the Sala
Dante. Cosimo de’ Medici healed a political
breach with Alfonso of Naples by sending him
a Manuscript of Livy; and Lorenzo declared
to Pico della Mirandola, probably where we
are now sitting, that, if his fortune proved insufficient,
he would pledge his furniture in order
to buy books. But, when your purse gives out,
you will spare my easy-chair, Veronica, won’t
you?‘</p>

<p>‘You have still not told us where you went
yesterday afternoon.’</p>

<p>Lamia remained silent; leaving it to the Poet
to reply:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<p>‘We carried some flowers to the grave of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.’</p>

<p>Again there was silence. Then, shortly, Veronica
asked:</p>

<p>‘Did nothing come of it?’</p>

<p>We all well knew the meaning of the question,
and so did he, and accordingly replied:</p>

<p>‘Well, yes, something came of it, such as it
is’; and, not waiting for us to express a desire
he was aware we all entertained, he unaffectedly
recited to us the following lines:—</p>

<h2 class="no-break"><a id="IV"></a>LAMIA’S WINTER-QUARTERS</h2>


<p>It was <i lang="it">Pasqua delle Rose</i>, literally Easter of Roses,
to distinguish it from <i lang="it">Pasqua delle Uova</i>, or Easter
of Eggs; in other words, Whitsuntide. We were
indebted to Lamia for this pretty designation,
which was new to all of us, and she had made
acquaintance with it in the course of conversation
with Perfetta, who, though by no means what her
name implied, and, indeed, as Veronica said, the
most imperfect of our native retainers, had long
since quite won Lamia’s heart by a spontaneous
compliment. Very early on in her study of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Italian, Lamia had displayed an extraordinarily
fine ear for the pronunciation of that language,
and a quick talent for assimilating its most familiar
phrases, so that Perfetta one day declared she must
surely be of Italian parentage.</p>

<p>‘Indeed she is not,’ I said. ‘Guess from what
land she comes?’</p>

<p>Perfetta looked at her for a moment, and then
exclaimed: ‘<i lang="it">Dal Paradiso</i>.’</p>

<p>Lamia treated this suggestion of celestial origin
with much levity, but, all the same, made Perfetta
a present of a gown which she declared was worn
out; though to my masculine perception it seemed
almost as good as new, and Veronica confirmed
my impression by reproving her for spoiling
Perfetta at the same time that she deprived herself
of a still very excellent garment.</p>

<p>‘I am sure,’ said Lamia, apologetically, ‘you
would not scold me if you had seen Perfetta’s
delight, and heard her expression of it. If one
gives a gown to one’s English maid, one receives
a most respectful “Thank you, Miss,” and never
hears another word about it; and, likely enough,
she sells it, having no sentiment on the subject
whatever. But Perfetta went into raptures over
the poor little gown, hugged it, kissed it, spread<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
it to the light, and has recurred to it again and
again. Indeed, to listen to her is to have a lesson
in Italian expletives of admiration. She would keep
it, she said, for Feast days, not even for ordinary
Sundays, unless perhaps she put it on, for the first
time, on the festival of her patron Saint. Finally,
she declared she would wear it, for the first time,
at <i lang="it">Pasqua delle Rose</i>, and so you saw her in it
yesterday. But, if I gave her the gown, I have
likewise made you all a present of a most beautiful
phrase; and, if you still are of opinion that I have
left myself short of a frock, it is always open to
any one to manifest gratitude by replacing it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>.‘</p>

<p>It was, indeed, an Easter, or, if you will, a
Whitsuntide, of Roses. They were everywhere;
clambering up the house, drooping from the roof,
running along the walls, carpeting the ground,
festooning themselves from elm to elm, interlaced
with the cypresses, peering through porch and
casement, covering stable and concealing shed,
scaling the tallest and seemingly most inaccessible
places, and thence falling down in untrained
profusion, veritable cascades of colour. We talked
of them from morning to night; we lived, moved,
and had our being among them, left them only to
go back to them, vowed these were the most
beautiful,—no, those,—no, those others, and perpetually
expressed ourselves in fickle and contradictory
adoration. As Lamia wandered among
them, she would break into song, chanting their
praises, now in one tongue, now in another.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Roses crimson, roses white,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Then she would remember snatches of Lorenzo’s
<cite>Canzone a Ballo</cite>, ‘<i lang="it">Ben venga Maggio</i>,’ written in
the local dialect of the time, and improvise for
them a suitable strain.</p>

<p>Then she would revert to her own tongue, in its
paraphrase of the pagan song the <i lang="it">Compagnacci</i>
used to troll in the days of Savonarola, when they
wanted to protest against the austerity of his
followers and the Burning of the Vanities.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<p>If we drove down to Florence, we drove
along roads that were avenues of roses; and, in
the Fair City itself, we forget to look at palace,
or façade, or bridge, absorbed in gazing on the
white and yellow Banksias that hung in bunches
and clusters over intramural garden-walls. But,
as the year expanded and deepened in beauty, we
grew more and more unwilling to stir from the
enchanting surroundings of the villa itself, unless
it were to wander in other <i lang="it">poderi</i> and among other
vineyards, or to make expeditions that took us uninterruptedly
through a world of radiant newness.
Lamia did not now inquire how we proposed to
employ ourselves, since being alive was in itself
occupation enough. Lest, however, as she said,
Veronica’s conscience should prick her for so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
time passed in the mere delight of doing nothing,
she read us the following passage written by Lorenzo
de’ Medici, and which she said she intended to
recite to a larger audience whenever she delivered
those lectures in the <i lang="it">Sala Dante</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>
<p>‘What can be more worthy of desire to a well-regulated
mind than the enjoyment of leisure with
dignity? That is what all good men wish to
attain, but what great men alone accomplish. In
the progress of public affairs we may indeed be
allowed to look forward to a period of rest; but
no repose should totally seclude us from attention
to the concerns of our country. I cannot deny
that the path it has been my lot to tread has been
arduous and rugged, full of danger, and beset with
treachery; but I console myself with the thought
of having contributed to the welfare of the State,
the prosperity of which now rivals that of any
other, however flourishing. Neither have I been
inattentive to the interests and advancement of my
family, having always proposed for my imitation
the example of my grandfather Cosimo, who
watched over his public and his private concerns
with equal vigilance. Having now attained the
object of my cares, I trust I may be allowed to
enjoy the sweets of leisure, to share in the reputation
of my fellow-citizens, and to exult in the glory
of my native city.’</p>

<p>‘The passage is very interesting,’ said the Poet,
‘and serves to strengthen one’s impression of the
sanity and completeness of Lorenzo’s talents.
But is it not also another contribution to the vanity
of human wishes and the fatuity of human self-complacency?
I do not think Lorenzo ever
attained to that enjoyment of dignity with leisure
of which he speaks; and assuredly he had not long
been dead before the glory of his native city, in the
sense in which he used the phrase, passed away.‘</p>

<p>‘If one is to believe Politian,’ I said, ‘either the
famous death-bed colloquy with Savonarola never
took place, or it left but little impression on the
dying man.’</p>

<p>‘That is a story,’ said the Poet, ‘one would
part with unwillingly. But what is it that Politian
says?’</p>

<p>‘That to judge by Lorenzo’s behaviour, and
that of his attendants, when he was dying, you
would have thought it was they who momentarily
expected that fate, and he alone that was exempt
from it.‘</p>

<p>‘There is no tomb nor inscription, is there,’
asked Lamia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span> ‘to mark the place that received his
ashes, while his unworthier successors have a
sumptuous monument designed by Michelangelo,
whom in the budding days of his genius Lorenzo
used to place, out of respect for his talent, above
his own sons at table?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose,’ said Veronica, ‘he was paid for
the monument he executed, and could not execute
the one the cost of which there was no one to
defray. But do not let us forget that what he felt
concerning the contrast between the earlier and the
later Medici is for ever embodied in his famous
quatrain. Repeat it to us, Lamia.’</p>

<p>‘With pleasure, if I can.‘</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Grato m’ è il sonno, e più l’ esser di sasso,</div>
  <div class="verse">Mentre che il danno e la vergogna dura.</div>
  <div class="verse">Non veder, non sentir, m’ è gran ventura:</div>
  <div class="verse">Però, non mi destar. Deh! parla basso.‘</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘How would one translate it?’</p>

<p>‘Translation is a difficult craft,’ said the Poet;
‘but, after visiting San Lorenzo again the other
day, I could not resist trying to render those noble
lines into our own tongue.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Nay, let me sleep, or, best, be stone or steel,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">While still endures this infamy of woe.</div>
  <div class="verse">My one sole bliss is nor to see nor feel:</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">So, wake me not; and, lest you should, speak low.’</div>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>
<p>‘How utterly out of place,’ said Lamia, ‘a
character like Michelangelo seems in Florentine
history! whereas Lorenzo is its very type and
representative.’</p>

<p>‘Do you not forget,’ said Veronica, ‘that
perhaps the three most austere human figures
known to us were Florentines, either by birth or by
adoption: Michelangelo, Dante, and Savonarola.’</p>

<p>‘That only makes it all the more strange,’ I
said.</p>

<p>‘But why?’ said the Poet. ‘Have we not, in
these days, succumbed too readily to the notion
that we are the creatures of our surroundings, and
what is called our <em>habitat</em>? And is not that theory
a mere <i lang="la">ex-post-facto</i> explanation that explains
nothing? Who would ever have thought of
predicting that any of the three great Puritans you
have named would be associated with Florence,
and the greatest of the three be born and bred in
the very heart of her? Must we not look elsewhere
for the explanation?’</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Know, Nature, like the cuckoo, laughs at law,</div>
  <div class="verse">Placing her eggs in whatso nest she will;</div>
  <div class="verse">And when, at callow-time, you think to find</div>
  <div class="verse">The sparrow’s stationary chirp, lo! bursts</div>
  <div class="verse">Voyaging voice to glorify the Spring.‘</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘In the same way characters, austere or the
reverse, make their appearance in the most unlikely
places. We hear too much, I think, of the Spirit
of the Age. Shall we not rather believe that the
Age is what great Spirits make it?’</p>

<p>‘There,’ said Veronica, ‘do you not press your
own theory too far? Without for one moment
denying that the sudden appearance of great
characters, or the place where they appear, is not
to be foretold, one can hardly help feeling that
Dante, Savonarola, and Michelangelo, in consequence
of something adverse in the Florentine
character, did not succeed in making Florence
what they would fain have made her.’</p>

<p>‘Truly great characters,’ said Lamia, ‘always
fail. Only second-rate people succeed. For my
part I am very glad of it, for nothing is so disappointing
as failure,—except success.’</p>

<p>‘There is a good deal in what you say,’ I was
rather surprised to hear the Poet reply. ‘But
perhaps we have all, and myself most of all, drifted
into a vein of exaggeration. I was betrayed into
it by the excessive claim which it seems to me many
nowadays advance for Science, as compared with
other sources of instruction and helps to life. Our
debt to Science is great. At the same time, it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
its limits, and I cannot think it is the greatest of
our obligations. Do you remember that profound
saying of Pascal, “<i lang="fr">La science des choses extérieures
ne me consolera pas de l’ignorance de la morale au
temps d’affliction, mais la science des mœurs me
consolera toujours de l’ignorance des sciences extérieures</i>”?
Such a line, for instance, as that of
Shakespeare,</p>

<p>
“In Nature there’s no blemish but the mind,”<br />
</p>

<p>is more deeply and enduringly helpful than steam-engines,
electric lights, or anæsthetics. One can,
in case of necessity, dispense with tramways and
telephones; but we cannot dispense with right
thinking and right feeling. The material discoveries
of the Age do it much honour; but man’s
triumph over matter is most nobly displayed when
he triumphs over the matter of which he is himself
composed; when he ignores physical pain, and
tramples on his non-spiritual passions. Science is
the language of the Intellect, Literature of the
Soul; and Poetry, the highest expression of Literature,
does for language, and sometimes for life,
what the Soul does for the body, and what this
glorious Italian sun does for mountain and plain:
it spiritualises matter. Let me add, lest I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
seem too partial to the particular art I practise so
imperfectly, that this is true of all imaginative
Art; and, far from fearing lest Science should sap
and supersede it, I trust and believe that Art will
ever remain its complement, and, where necessary,
its corrective.‘</p>

<p>‘Do you consider Italians,’ asked Lamia, ‘artistic
or scientific, material or spiritual?’</p>

<p>‘They are both, surely,’ he replied. ‘But, if
we took the modern Florentine as the Italian type,
I fear we would have to reply they are rather too
prone to worship material science. The artistic
faculty in them seems almost extinct, save for
purposes of imitation; and, even when they imitate
the art of the past, they do so without any discrimination
between the good and the bad. But
in railways, telegraphs, telephones, tramways, they
take inexhaustible delight. They have disfigured
much of Florence, and most of Rome, in their
determination not to lag behind in the general
march of what is termed material progress.’</p>

<p>‘Is it not,’ suggested Veronica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> ‘that they are
essentially a practical race? When the world first
took to commerce, the Florentines became great
merchants and great bankers. When Popes and
Princes posed as patrons of architecture, sculpture
and painting, they produced palaces, statues, and
pictures.’</p>

<p>‘Just so,’ said Lamia; ‘and now that the whole
world has taken to travelling, Representative Institutions,
and Music Halls, they have Circular Tours
and a popular Parliament, both of which they
work exceedingly badly, and a <i lang="it">Caffè Savonarola
Spettacolo Diverso</i>, a piece of profanation for which
I confess I should like to smack them.’</p>

<p>‘There is a good deal of vulgarity,’ I ventured
to plead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> ‘in modern life, and in compliance
with the theory you have all been pressing, they
are vulgar accordingly. But would it not be
more indulgent, and equally true, to say that Italy
is the one country, and the Italians are the one
race, whose vitality is inexhaustible? They have
been well before the world, if you will pardon that
expression, for more than two thousand five
hundred years; and, during all that period, they
have never altogether dropped out of sight.
Neither do they now appear in the least disposed
to retire into private life, or to preserve their
ruins, however much some of us would like them
to do so, for the satisfaction of our romantic
feelings. Who would have believed, asked Saint
Jerome fifteen hundred years ago, that Rome
would ever be sunk so low that, at the very seat
of its Empire, it would be reduced to fight, not
for glory, but for self-preservation. Yet what do
we see to-day? Rome, not only safe against
foreign assault, but, with the aid of railways and
Maxim guns, meditating new triumphs and new
glories.’</p>

<p>‘That,’ said the Poet, and I felt much flattered
by his approval, ‘is the more generous, and therefore
the more just way of putting it. The Italians
have a great Past, which they refuse to forget. It
still continues to animate their ambition, and forbids
them to rest satisfied with that <i lang="it">dolce far niente</i>
with which they once were reproached. When
the period of the Renaissance came to an end,
Italy might have seemed to say, in the words of
Nero, <i lang="la">Qualis artifex pereo</i>, and to perish most
artistically. But Italy was <em>not</em> dead, as she has
shown so clearly during the last thirty years.
One’s only regret is that the existing type of
national greatness is so costly, that Italians have to
pay a desperately heavy price for refusing to exist
without it.‘</p>

<p>‘People,’ said Lamia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span> ‘frequently complain of
the excessive loads Italian carters expect their
horses and their mules to draw. But the whole of
Italy seems to me to be suffering from the same
infliction.’</p>

<p>‘I fear,’ observed Veronica, ‘there is much
truth in what you say. Only yesterday I
remonstrated with the driver of the carriage I had
hired to bring me back to the Villa, because his
horse seemed in a shockingly poor condition. His
answer was, “<i lang="it">Campa come me</i>,—he fares as I do.
When I have plenty, he has plenty. When I have
little, there is little for him also. When there are
more <i lang="it">forestieri</i>, he will have more oats.”‘</p>

<p>‘Let us have a carriage apiece every afternoon,’
said Lamia, ‘and do what we all shall hate, drive
round and round the <i lang="it">Cascine</i> from five to seven.
Only, in that case, I <em>must</em> have that new gown.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘A firefly! A firefly!’</p>

<p>It was Veronica, invariably the most observant
of us, whose voice called to us to welcome the
fairy visitor, whose arrival is as delightful and
momentous an event in Italy as the wing of the
first swallow, the call of the first cuckoo, or the
note of the first nightingale, in England. We
were all on the alert in a moment, calling in
return:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>
<p>‘Where? Where?’</p>

<p>It was a single, solitary firefly, for one may
say of fireflies as of primroses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">First you come by ones and ones,</div>
  <div class="verse">Lastly in battalions,</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>and it moved and twinkled in the deepening
twilight, among the olive-trees, a miniature and
terrestrial planet, having no fixed orbit. I need
scarcely say that this was some days before <i lang="it">Pasqua
delle Rose</i>, though Whitsuntide happened to be an
early one; and, the following night, we saw three,
and, the night after, seven. Then, for May can
be capricious in Tuscany as elsewhere, the weather
was not propitious for them. But, by the time
the moon was nearly at full, they were plenteous
as stars in the Milky Way; and while they flitted
and glistened among the darkening leaves, the
nightingales rejoiced and enlivened each other with
the song that an ancient story and inherited
association have transformed for us into a strain of
imaginary sadness. Life offers no more enchanting
combination of sensations than fall to one’s
lot on a warm Italian night in May, when moonlight,
fireflies, and nightingales weave their
concerted charm; and, night after night, we
repaired to the same antique marble seat, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
we liked to think Lorenzo and his associates had
often sat, in front of the same dark silent cypresses,
and drank in the same sweet, grave, harmonious
delights. Perhaps you think us a company of
selfish Hedonists, wholly given up to pleasurable
sensations, poor weak copies of our Pagan
Renaissance predecessors on the self-same spot?
Whether that be true or not of some of us, I will
not undertake to say. But certainly it is not true
of Veronica, nor yet, I think, of Lamia. Indeed,
speaking generally, I think one ought to entertain
one’s friends with a record of one’s happiness
rather than with a recital of one’s woes; but it
does not follow, does it, that there is no pathetic
minor in one’s life because one is not always
sounding it? Indeed, amid all the enchantments
of that Italian season when Spring and
Summer are indistinguishable, we had been
conscious of the shadow of pain which is cast by the
surely approaching extinction of a young life in
one’s own immediate precincts; and the shadow
was all the darker because the season was so bright.
Ilaria, the youngest and comeliest of the daughters
of our <i lang="it">contadini</i>, whose acquaintance you perhaps
remember our first making, had, we were assured,
till within a twelvemonth ago, more than justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
her pretty name by the joyousness of her ways.
But there was a canker in the bud, which thus was
destined never to open fully to the meridian of life;
and, shortly after our arrival, her figure was no
longer seen among the olives, or her voice heard
among the vines. Veronica was much troubled by
the utter lack of creature comforts in the spacious
<i lang="it">casa colonica</i>, or farmhouse, where Ilaria was patiently
awaiting the end, though in reality their absence
was only part of that rudimentary simplicity of
existence which is universal among a people
untainted by Northern ideas of luxury. She and
Lamia were unremitting in their visits, their
nursing, and their solicitude. But these proved
unavailing; and <i lang="it">Pasqua delle Rose</i> had to spare
some of its luxuriant blooms for the grave of
poor Ilaria. In the simple rustic household where
she had left a vacant place, we liked to think
that, in the daytime at least, the continual demands
of Nature, in her busiest and most growing
season, on the energy and co-operation of Man,
diverted their thoughts somewhat from the missing
figure; but, when we met and wished them good-day
in the <i lang="it">podere</i>, tying the vines, training the <i lang="it">pomi-d’oro</i>,
or cutting the sweet green fodder, that smile
of which I once spoke as invariably accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
their salutations for awhile vanished from their
faces, and at nightfall we knew they were brought
into undistracted consciousness of their bereavement.
We grieved for them, and felt, moreover,
a separate grief of our own; and neither the
luminous May moon, nor the fairy-flitting fireflies,
nor the silvery fluting of the nightingale, could
wean us from the gravity of our thoughts. Even
the purest and most generous sympathy borrows
something of its tenderness, I suppose, from the
knowledge that we are one and all subject to the
dispensation of grief, and that those who console
to-day may themselves need to be consoled to-morrow;
and this is peculiarly so with the advent
of the shadow of death, from which not even the
strongest nor the most sanguine can hope to
escape. Thus, without saying it, we were all, I
suspect, musing on our common mortality, and
thinking how the continuance of the deepest and
dearest of our joys depends on the favour and
forbearance of Heaven.</p>

<p>But the Poet has a theory, which we have all
more or less adopted, and which he generally expresses
by the words, ‘Cheerfulness is the most
serviceable form of human charity’; and he never,
if he can prevent it, permits us to linger over-long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
in the fruitless gloom of sentimental sorrow. I
think that was why, on the fourth evening after
we had strewn the roses on Ilaria’s grave, he recited
to us, uninvited,—an unusual thing with him,—the
following consolatory lines:—</p>

<p>As the time drew nearer and nearer for leaving
the Tuscan home where we had been so happy,
Veronica began to manifest a certain solicitude, in
consequence of our leisurely and unsystematic
ways, lest we should have omitted to make Lamia
acquainted with some cloister or bas-relief, some
bit of quaint street architecture, or some hillside
sanctuary, ignorance whereof might expose
her to the reproach of a want of intelligent curiosity.
But we found the omissions were few and
unimportant, and this left us all the more free,
during the now brief and regretful remainder of
our sojourn, to pay farewell visits to the frescoes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and altar-pieces, the monuments and statues, that
had most engaged her affections. Where Giotto
worked, where Savonarola preached, where Fra
Angelico painted and prayed, where Michelangelo
fought, where Dante sate, where Donatello slept, in
death as in life not severed from his beloved
Medicean patron, these and kindred spots had to
be seen just once more. When one quits a place
where one has been residing for some little time,
one says good-bye to one’s friends; and these
were, one and all, very dear friends to us, and we
could not but take of them affectionate farewell.
The <i lang="it">Luca della Robbia</i> in the <i lang="it">Ospedale degli
Innocenti</i>, the Perugino in the <i lang="it">Maddalena dei
Pazzi</i>, the Fountain by Verrocchio in the cortile of
the <i lang="it">Palazzo Vecchio</i>, the recumbent Bishop in <i lang="it">San
Miniato</i>, the Mino da Fiesole in the <i lang="it">Badia</i>, the
bronze David in the <i lang="it">Bargello</i>;—but, unless I have
a care, I shall fall into the fault I have been trying
to avoid, of troubling you with a catalogue of
familiar names. There were favourite spots, too,
to drive to once again, happily too numerous to
cite, and too lovely for any one to be so foolish as to
attempt to describe. Exception, however, shall be
made of one of these, for I fancy it is but little
known, and therefore has not become hackneyed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
Accident made us acquainted with it, and design
had often and often taken us there again. It was
in a <i lang="it">podere</i> some two miles or so outside the Porta
San Niccolò, whence, over a wall lined with irises,
one looks down the river immediately in front of
one straight away to Florence, but sees nothing
there save, through the feathery foliage of
distant poplars, the cupola of the Duomo, Giotto’s
campanile, and the Tower of the Palazzo Vecchio.
Beyond, far beyond, are visible, on propitious
days, the majestic peaks of the Carrara Mountains,
and, a little farther towards the north, the snowy
summits of the Apennines above Pistoia. It was
a place that fascinated us, and we returned to it
again and again. One evening, when the light was
even exceptionally beautiful, but the air a little chill,
and we had therefore, for Lamia’s sake, to curtail
our enjoyment of it, I remember her exclaiming:</p>

<p>‘O, do let us stay. Even if it were deadly, it
would be worth dying for. It may never be so
beautiful again.’</p>

<p>That expresses a feeling which, I think, one
often has in Italy. It is the intense beauty of
certain moments, certain views, certain sunsets,
that makes one declare one never before has seen
anything so lovely, and dread lest on such loveli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>ness
one never more may gaze. A foolish fear;
for to-morrow renews the radiance and raptures of
to-day.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill14"></a>
<img src="images/i_211.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">OUR TUSCAN GARDEN</div>
</div>

<p>But the closing hours of the now lengthening
days were always spent in the <i lang="it">loggia</i>, the
garden, or the <i lang="it">podere</i> of our Villa; and Veronica,
who, so English at home, was here the most Italian
of us all, would, whenever the weather permitted,
arrange for us to have our evening meal <i lang="it">al fresco</i>,
in the society of the roses and the nightingales.
Lamia had, as you may suppose, picked up many
a Tuscan <i lang="it">stornello</i> and <i lang="it">canzone</i>, and would sing
them to us, to the accompaniment of her guitar;
and, between song and song, discourse would run
on all the beauty and the wonders we had seen
that day.</p>

<p>‘What is it,’ said Lamia, ‘that, more than
anything else, constitutes the charm of Italy?’</p>

<p>‘Ancientness,’ said the Poet, ‘and an ancientness
that never grows old. For Italy, notwithstanding
its centuries of history, art, warfare,
misfortune, remains perennially young. More
than once, the rash have said, “Italy is dead.”
Italy never dies. She has the gift of perpetual life;
but, with all her indestructible freshness, she carries
about her the dignity of bygone times and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
majesty of tradition. The new is always more or
less vulgar. Refinement is the work of time.
You remember Aristotle’s definition of Aristocracy,
Ancient riches. Italy has ancient riches, the riches
of law, religion, poetry, and the arts, long established,
and she has therefore what is most precious
in aristocracy. She has ancient speech and ancient
manners. Her mountains are necessarily ancient,
the Soracte of Horace, the Alps of Hannibal.
But her plains and valleys are equally so, for she
has an ancient agriculture. We are sitting at this
moment surrounded by a rural cultivation that is
described with absolute accuracy in the <cite>Georgics</cite>,
and again by Politian in his <cite>Rusticus</cite>, written on
this very spot, and that has not changed since the
days of Cincinnatus. Listen to that fellow singing
among the olives. Virgil has described him,—<i lang="la">Canit
fundator ad auras</i>,—and might be his contemporary.
It is this far-backness, if I may coin
a word to express my meaning, that sheds a
glamour over everything in Italy, a far-backness,
however, that endures and persists, that is with us
and around us, and compels us to bend with
reverence before it, as we must ever do before the
parent Past we still have with us. In proportion
as Italy parts with its Past, Italy will lose its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
charm. The temptation to do so in this age is
great, and I fear it is not being sufficiently resisted.</p>

<p>‘Dear Poet,’ said Lamia, ‘will you forgive me
if I object that I have sometimes been told, though
I am sure most inaccurately, that I, for instance,
am charming; and yet I am not ancient.’</p>

<p>‘Dear Lamia,’ he replied, ‘you are very ancient,
and are under deep obligation to ancestors you
never saw, and probably never heard of; and I
hope you will be yet more charming for your visit
to this old and captivating land. For my part, I
always seem to miss something in people who have
not fallen under its spell. You have succumbed
to it entirely. I shall never weary, and I hope I
shall never weary you, in extolling the power of
the Past. Would the descant of those nightingales
have the same charm for us, if they had not
been singing thus for myriads of Mays? Spring
is so irresistibly charming because it recalls and
renews the Aprils that are gone. Time consecrates
and confirms. The deeper our roots, the
loftier our thoughts, and the sounder our hearts.
I remember a great poet of this age saying to me
that he could not see that, as some one had
affirmed, he in his writings so much resembled
Keats. “You are Keats’s own child,” I replied,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
“and are of noble parentage.” But indeed every
great poet is the lineal descendant of every other
great poet. At any given moment, what exercises
most influence is, not the present, but the Past.
I ventured, the other day, to observe that there
are only two sorts of people, the noble and the
ignoble. Dear Lamia, let us try to belong to the
noble, since every one may be a member of that
untitled aristocracy; so that, when we ourselves
are, as some of us are gradually becoming, portions
of the Past, we may influence beneficently an unborn
Future.‘</p>

<p>‘There never was anything more untrue,’ said
Lamia, who was quick to surmise the more personal
meaning that underlay those closing words,
‘than the saying “<i lang="fr">On n’est jeune qu’une fois</i>.” I
have been old several times; but I always get
young again.‘
‘And you will do so very often, I dare say, for
many years to come. Moreover, I like to think
there is the youth of one’s youth, the youth of
one’s manhood, and, finally, the youth of one’s old
age. But, when one has reached this last, man’s
capacity for rejuvenescence is exhausted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>.‘</p>

<p>Lamia rose from her seat, placed herself close
beside him, and taking his hand, replied:</p>

<p>‘Dear Poet, even in my youngest moments,
compared with you I am in my dotage.’ And I
would at that moment have been any age you will,
to be treated thus tenderly.</p>

<p>We made many expeditions of which I have not
told you, just as we visited, again and again,
churches, palaces, and dismantled monasteries I
have not named. But Lamia particularly wished
to see a Convent,—a Convent, that is to say, in
the Italian signification, of monks, not disestablished,
but allowed still to survive, with a certain
number of its inmates, as a national monument.
She had heard me speak of the attractive hospitality
I had enjoyed in them in days gone by; and we
selected for our monastic excursion a Convent in
the Apennines not too remote from Florence, and
the drive to which would take us through
Gavinana, a spot none of us had ever visited.
Does the word Gavinana suggest anything to
you? Probably not; yet it was there that the
liberties of Florence received their final extinction.
Indeed I fancy that, of the thousands of people
who nowadays visit the Tuscan Capital, many are
unaware that, in the earlier part of the sixteenth
century, it underwent a Siege whose incidents
strongly resemble many that occurred during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
siege of another Capital nearly thirty years ago.
Only Florence is much more beautiful than Paris,
and less suggestive of the horrors of war. Yet
the Siege of Florence lasted ten months, or more
than twice as long as that of Paris; its inhabitants
underwent far greater hardships, and displayed
much greater heroism. We might have been a little
sceptical on those points had Florentine historians
been our only authority for them. But the copious
and impartial Reports of the Venetian Ambassadors
who were in the Fair City at the time render doubt
impossible, and establish the courage, pertinacity,
and patience of the besieged against Emperor and
Pope. All the villas within a certain radius of
Florence were rased to the ground, lest they should
furnish help and corn to the besiegers; and all its
silver plate, both sacred and profane, was melted
down to replenish the coffers of the Republic. It
is the noblest, perhaps it is the one perfectly noble,
incident in the story of Florence; and I sometimes
have thought, and the Poet agrees with me, that
Francesco Ferruccio, whose statue is among that
series of famous Florentines outside the Uffizi, is its
most heroic and effective figure. He would in all
probability have saved Florence, had the timidity of
some of his fellow-countrymen, and the treachery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of others, allowed him; for he proposed to create
a diversion by marching on Rome, and menacing
it with another sack such as had recently taken
place under the Constable Bourbon. His project
was overruled, and he died fighting in the piazza at
Gavinana; his only consolation, in his last moments,
being that the Leader of the Imperial Army, the
Prince of Orange, was also slain. ‘The ill-omened
spot,’ says the historian of the Commonwealth of
Florence, ‘lies within sight of the traveller as he
passes, about a mile to the right of it, on his way
from Pistoia to Modena. And not a peasant of
those mountains, though ignorant as his yoke of
dove-coloured oxen of all the history of his country
from that day to this, not a goat-herd tending his
flock by the roadside, not a grimy muleteer bringing
down his string of charcoal-laden beasts from
the forests of the Upper Apennine, will be unable
to point out to the stranger the field on which,
nearly four hundred years ago, Tuscan liberty was
fought for and lost.’</p>

<p>Drinking our coffee, for which we paid an
incredibly small sum, under the plane trees of the
square where Ferruccio and Florence fell, we again
discoursed on the arbitrary hazards of Time that
made the City justly called Fair, and to which one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
is often disposed to apply what Ovid represents
Helen as saying to her Grecian paramour:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Apta magis Veneri quam sunt tua corpora Marti:</div>
  <div class="verse">Bella gerant alii; tu, Paris, semper ama,’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>a place of arms, a city woeful and intrepid, the
champion of freedom against Sceptre and Tiara.</p>

<p>‘Surely,’ said Lamia, ‘Dante would have forgiven
Florence could he have lived to see that
day. The times were grim, and the deeds austere
enough even for one “who had seen Hell.”
Would you not rather,‘ she continued, turning
to the Poet, ‘have it said of you that you had
seen Heaven?’</p>

<p>‘Remember,’ said Veronica, ‘Dante saw both.’</p>

<p>The twilight was deepening into dusk before
we reached the Convent whither we were bound,
for our driver had taken a wrong turning during
the last few miles of our journey; and Lamia was
quick to note, as characteristic of Italy, that, when
inquiry put us on the right one, the directions
given were, not as in England, according to signposts,
but to little tabernacles or shrines at the
parting of the ways: now of the Annunciation,
now of Saint Agatha or Saint Barbara, now of Saint
Francis of Assisi receiving the Stigmata. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
afraid her curiosity was more piqued than satisfied
when we reached our bourne; for, though we were
most piously welcomed, Veronica and she were not
allowed to violate that portion of the Convent
which is defended from female gaze by the word
<i lang="la">Clausura</i>; and she not unnaturally, though quite
inaccurately, imagined that she was not shown
what was most worth seeing. The Poet and I
were allotted sleeping-cells within the Monastery,
but our companions, of course, had to pass the
night in the <i lang="it">Foresteria</i>, or strangers’ quarter, outside,
in charge of a lay-brother, and it was there
we all had our truly ascetic supper. But the guests
of Sallust never enjoyed one more; for our host,
the Prior, was an ideal monk, majestic yet saintly
of aspect, with long flowing beard, silky and snowy,
measured manners, and paternally caressing voice.
The Rules of his Order forbid any instrumental
accompaniment either at Mass or the other Sacred
Offices of the twenty-four hours; but he had
always loved music for its own sake, and he had
made for himself a primitive sort of spinette, on
which he said he would play to us, for our further
entertainment, when the lay-brother who was waiting
on us had retired, and all the Confraternity
were in their first deep sleep. The performance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
like the instrument, was touching in its simplicity;
and Veronica, wishing to make him some return,
said that Lamia, too, was fond of music, and would,
she was quite sure, sing to him if he cared to hear
her. Even in the <i lang="it">Foresteria</i>, I fear, there was a
touch of the profane in the suggestion; but he
evidently could not resist the temptation thus
presented to him, and begged Lamia to sing,
but with not too loud and penetrating a voice.
She at once broke into the wild and melancholy
chant the Italian recruits used to sing in the days
of Napoleon, when they were dragged from their
homes to face the snows of Russia:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Partir, partir bisogna,</div>
  <div class="verse indent8">Dove commanderà il mio Sovrano.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>But Lamia got no further than those two lines;
for our venerable host suddenly exclaimed, the
colour mounting to his face, and the tears brimming
in his eyes:</p>

<p>‘Stop! stop! <i lang="it">Mi monta la fantasia.</i>’ And
he went on to tell us how he had not heard
that strain for five-and-forty years, and that it
used to be sung by one whose caprice had caused
him to abandon the world and assume the habit of
Saint Bruno.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>On our journey homeward, the following morning,
Lamia asked:</p>

<p>‘How would you translate the words the dear
old Prior used last night, <i lang="it">Mi monta la fantasia</i>?’</p>

<p>‘They are not easily rendered into another
tongue,’ said Veronica, ‘for they mean so much in
the original. But when he said, “the fantasy
mounts and seizes hold of me,” he doubtless meant
that your voice suddenly made him feel all he had
felt five-and-forty years ago.‘</p>

<p>‘O, how delightful!’ said Lamia. ‘Then I
forced the <i lang="it">Clausura</i>, after all.’</p>

<p>‘It is a pity,’ said Veronica, whose sane nature
and active temperament render her a little intolerant
of monasticism in any form, ‘that you could not
break it down altogether, and so make an end
of it.’</p>

<p>‘And yet,’ said the Poet, who has rather more
indulgence for the weaknesses of human nature,
perhaps because he shares them more, ‘I doubt if
we have done with the motives, many and various,
that once engendered and still foster monasticism.
The strong, the valiant, the sensible, require no
shelter from the rough usage of the world. But,
as in the days of savage militarism, so in these of
an almost equally pitiless industrialism, terror,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
timidity, indolence, mysticism, love of meditation,
longing for silence, and a certain passive piety,
make men fly the market-place for the cloister.
When Dante, exiled from Florence, appeared at
the Convent in the Apennines, and was asked
by the monks who he might be, did he not
answer, “One who is in quest of peace”? There
is no second Dante, but there are many exiles in
this modern world, and I fear their number every
day increases. As the struggle for existence waxes
fiercer and fiercer, I think I hear them, too, exclaiming,
<i lang="la">Dona nobis pacem</i>.‘</p>

<p>‘Listening first to Veronica,’ said Lamia, ‘and
then to you, I am forced to the conclusion that
many things are intolerable which we cannot do
without. Yet I confess a Convent of Nuns seems
more natural than a Confraternity of Monks.’</p>

<p>‘More natural, perhaps,’ said the Poet, ‘but
hardly so necessary. For, even in the very heart
of the world, every good woman is more or less
nunlike, by virtue of her purity, her reserve——’</p>

<p>‘And, I suppose,’ interrupted Lamia, ‘her
obedience?’</p>

<p>Nothing disconcerted, he re-echoed the words:
‘And her obedience.’</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill15"></a>
<img src="images/i_227.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THROUGH THE OLIVES, FLORENCE</div>
</div>

<p>‘Have you not, dear,’ asked Veronica,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> ‘confuted
yourself by anticipation? It was a man, not a
woman, was it not, that took leave of the Prior,
who would fain have detained him, with the words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">‘Father, farewell! Be not distressed,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And take my vow, ere I depart,</div>
  <div class="verse">To found a Convent in my breast,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And keep a cloister in my heart.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>‘One is constantly confuting oneself,’ he
replied.</p>

<p>‘How should it be otherwise?’ said Lamia.
‘Verse being the expression, not of the convictions,
but of the emotions, poets cannot be taxed with
inconsistency, though they contradict themselves
a thousand times.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you, dear Lamia,’ he said. ‘You are
the most ingenious of apologists. If ever I have
to defend myself, you shall be my Portia.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the last day, the last night, and then the
very morning of departure at length arrived, when
Florence, with its gorgeous towers and cloud-capped
palaces, was, for a time at least, to dissolve
like the baseless fabric of a vision. Perfetta was
in tears; Ippolito had a <i lang="la">mazzetto</i> of carnations
for us all; the <i lang="la">contadini</i> desisted from their work
to cluster in the garden in order to see us off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
with many gracious words and expressions of hope
that next year we should return; and the entire
household manifested by melancholy smiles their
sorrow at our going. Pasquale, the <i lang="it">cameriere</i>,
had come into my room early that morning with
a doleful face, and, in reply to a renewed inquiry
whether we could not help him to find another
place, assured me that he would not care to serve
anybody else; and he launched into touching
eulogies of Veronica’s considerateness and universal
capacity, of Lamia’s irresistible charm, of the
genius of the Poet,—<i lang="it">Il Gran Poeta</i>, he called
him, though utterly ignorant, I need scarcely
say, of the very language in which that retiring
person writes,—and of the thousand-and-one
virtues which, finally, he ascribed to myself. If
you think that he was insincere, because he in some
degree exaggerated, I can assure you that you are
mistaken. He believed it all.</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ he said. ‘<i lang="it">Ringrazio tanto la sua
signoria</i>, but I could not serve any one else.
<i lang="it">Riprenderò il mio antico mestiere</i>’ (I will return
to my old calling).</p>

<p>‘And what may that be?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘Do you not know?’ he said. ‘<i lang="it">Io son comico</i>’
(I am an actor).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>The dear people we were leaving are all of
them so much more or less histrionic, that
Pasquale’s occasionally fine gestures had never
struck me as singular or exceptional.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Sì, Signore, son comico io</i>,’ he went on, ‘I am
an actor, and have played at Lucca, at Fiesole,
at Pisa, yes and at Siena. Once I was in the same
cast with the stupendous tragedian, Salvini.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, a great actor, indeed,’ I said. ‘I once
saw him in an Italian version of our English
drama <cite>Othello</cite>.’</p>

<p>He was in his early morning dress, wearing no
coat nor jacket, and having in his turned-up white
apron my boot-trees, which he was just about to
pack. But he drew himself up with much dignity,
and, with the one disengaged hand suiting the
action to the word, he said:</p>

<p>‘I, too, have played the part of Otello.’ And,
without more ado, he recited, in his sonorous
language, the lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!</div>
  <div class="verse">Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars;</div>
  <div class="verse">That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And the earnestness with which he recited that
pathetic passage completely submerged the sense of
humour that was beginning to rise in me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>As we entered Florence, so did we quit it,
leisurely, and without the disenchanting scenes of a
modern railway station. We were to drive across
the Apennines to Bologna, and, as we reached the
last flower-stall near the Gate that looks thitherward,
Lamia expressed a wish for one more flower. It
was a lovely rose, the only one on a plant that
occupied among the others the place of honour.</p>

<p>‘It is a pity to spoil the plant,’ said the woman,
who was well known to us, for we had often
halted to make purchases from her. ‘Will not
another serve equally well?’</p>

<p>You will easily surmise Lamia’s reply. No
rose in the world but that one would have satisfied
her desire.</p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Come vuole</i>, said the woman (‘be it as you
wish’), and she severed the fair flower from its
stalk.</p>

<p>‘How much is it?’ I asked, eagerly availing
myself of the opportunity to make dear Lamia
a parting gift from the City of Flowers.</p>

<p>‘Don’t trouble about it,‘ said the woman, ‘you
can pay some other time.’</p>

<p>‘But there will be no other time,’ said Lamia,
‘for we are going away for good and all.’</p>

<p>‘<i lang="it">Dunque, non si paga. Addio, e buon viaggio!</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>‘was the reply.
(‘In that case, you must not pay at all. Happy be your journey! Good-bye!’)</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If people love their home, there is no wrong
time for coming back to it; and, were it not for
the delight of returning, I doubt if it would be
wise, save under compulsion, ever to leave it.
Tacitus asks, Who would quit Italy for Germany,
were it not that Germany is his own country?
Over English folk, at all worthy of their great
descent, the name of England exercises a more
enthralling spell even than that of Italy; and the
Garden that I love is all the dearer to me because
it is thoroughly English. But the moment for
returning to it fell out most felicitously; and,
gazing on the scene that awaited us, we were
instantly weaned from all regret even for the sky
and sunshine of Tuscany. Under the broad-trunked,
wide-spreading Oak,—Veronica has
christened this particular plot of ground the Oak
Parlour,—Five O’Clock Tea was waiting for us,
and once more we looked on one of those Urns
which, I am told, have made the owner’s name a
household word in many kindly hearts. I need
not say again how happy we had been in our
Tuscan villa, and I verily believe that Veronica
would contrive to make us comfortable in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
desert of Sahara. But it is idle to pretend that
all we mean by the word ‘Home’ is to be had
save in this, our own island; and there is all the
difference in the world between Perfetta and the
tearful <i lang="it">cameriere</i> who, I suppose, has now returned
to his <i lang="it">antico mestiere</i>, and is smothering
Desdemona before some provincial Tuscan audience,
and the Northern handmaidens who, moulded by
the genius of Veronica, perform with noiseless
celerity every office that can minister to the grace
of existence. Do not think me material if I say
that that first Five O’Clock Tea in the Oak
Parlour after our return was an event in our life;
for its charm was compounded of many elements,
into which entered the abiding influence of unluxurious
domestic refinement. The green antiquity
of the oak, the smooth verdure of the lawn, unattainable,
I fear, by the services of a shepherd
lass and her flock of nibbling sheep, the luxuriance
and variety of the flowers, the view, under the
oaken branches, of the Manor-House, white with
roses from ground to gable, the snowy face of the
tablecloth, the glow of the burnished urn, the
brightness, the spotlessness, the seemliness of everything,
all contributed to the welcome that attended
us, and to the pleasure we received from it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>But something more awaited us than the
renewal of old delights. Shortly before we started
for our six months’ absence, we had decided, after
much deliberation, to add, in a modest way, to
the home that we had a thousand times declared,
in our optimistic fashion, to be already ample for
our needs; and the result was now before us.
You may easily imagine our anxiety to discern if
the decision had been wise or the reverse; for,
though we had gone into the plan with a most
competent architect to the utmost detail, and though
Veronica had brought her practical and tasteful
mind to bear upon window and overmantel,
hinge and door-plate, moulding and lining-paper,
there is always a danger lest instructions should
have been misunderstood or imperfectly carried
out, or that the instructions themselves were
wholly or in part a mistake. We were prepared
to be pleased, but also to criticise; but for fault-finding
there was, in truth, no possible room.
Animated by reverence for what already existed,
we had bound architect and builder to certain
well-defined lines and curves, prohibiting externally
all originality save what is perhaps the best
kind of it in these days, pious and humble reproduction
of what is already recognised as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
beautiful. A room, which was originally spoken
of as a billiard-room, and which for a brief while
retained that designation, though all idea of having
a billiard-table in it had been promptly abandoned,
and which now is known as the Morning Room,
because, as Lamia says, we nearly always sit there
of an evening, a new boudoir for Veronica, who
has at last a refuge of her own worthy of her
beneficent labours, three new sleeping-chambers,
and another staircase, composed the new quarter.
And will you believe it?—it was already furnished;
Veronica having made due preparations and
given minute instructions for this end partly
before our departure, and partly during our
absence. Now, did she triumph over us in the
matter of those various purchases in Florence that
used to move our ignorant mirth; for everything
she had acquired had been sent home in time to
be unpacked and placed in the room and the
position allotted to it. Thus, at every turn, we
were reminded of the Fair City and the bewitching
land we had so lately left, and of which, not to be
ungrateful, we still talked affectionately even in the
hours of our home-coming.</p>

<p>But Veronica had no monopoly of success in
the swift adornment of our new wing. I, too,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
had a little triumph of my own, but, I need
scarcely say, out-of-doors. I do not often sing
my own praises, do I, preferring to extol the Poet
and Veronica, who are more deserving of eulogy.
But, on this occasion, I think I really did deserve
the congratulations that were lavished on me.
For, with a truly foreseeing mind, I had been
growing on, to use a gardener’s phrase, a certain
number of climbing roses, clematis, jessamine, and
other creepers, and had given the strictest injunctions
that they were to be planted against
the new building the very instant the masons had
finished it, and were to be fostered and trained
with constant and unremitting attention; and, as
they were then already robust in growth and
vigorous at the root, they were well on their way
up the new wing on our arrival. A legend has
since grown up that I did not leave England at
all, but remained on the spot with barrow, trug,
and trowel, and that, fast as the work-people laid
a course of stone or brick, I planted a creeper.
But, as a fact, it happened as I have said.</p>

<p>As for the garden, the garden that the too
kindly sympathy of others permits one to say we
all love, I can only say I wish the whole of Italy
could have seen it. The Tea Roses, more numer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>ous
and more beautiful than ever, seemed smilingly
to say, ‘Has Tuscany roses to show more fair?’
Larkspurs, of every imaginable shade of blue,
from azure to cerulean; lupines, white, purple, and
yellow; foxgloves, snowy-white and without a
freckle; seemed to challenge each other as to which
would tower highest in the summer air. The
Pæony Poppies, some purposely some accidentally
sown, were a garden in themselves, fair but fugitive,
yet making up by their number and infinite
variety for the briefness of their existence. They
were everywhere in the beds and borders, and, as it
seemed, where they had chosen to be; there, by the
right of supreme loveliness, and the Swan-neck
Poppies, the Caucasian, and the Victoria Cross,
rocked more humbly beside them. No other
plant of such supreme beauty has so solid a stem
and such imposing foliage for so fragile a flower;
and this it is, I think, which mainly constitutes its
fresh charm. Every one now loves flowers, and I
have no need to weary you with a catalogue of those
in the Garden that I Love. But I doubt if there
be any perennial plant of real beauty and value
that will grow in our latitude which is not to be
found there; and I can say with truth, of every
bed and border, that you could not see the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
for flowers. As for the winding turf walk, which
perhaps you remember as the South Enclosure, it
is not I who will say what it looked like when we
returned. For one who has justly acquired honour,
not only by the beauty of her own home, but by her
charming pages concerning all that appertains to a
garden, and who had visited it the day before our
arrival, left a little line for Veronica, in which she
generously said it was the loveliest she had ever seen.
I should hesitate to repeat so flattering an opinion,
were it not for some injustice to myself that
followed. ‘As for the winding turf walk and its
glow of bloom and colour on either side,’ said the
kindly writer, ‘nowhere, I am sure, is there anything
like it; and only the Poet could have conceived
it.’ As if it was the Poet who had conceived
it! It was I who,—but so it is in this
unfair world, where everybody bows down before
prestige. Lamia herself could not have been
more partial or more unjust.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a id="ill16"></a>
<img src="images/i_241.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">LARKSPURS</div>
</div>

<p>I made some observation of the kind to Veronica,
imagining we were alone, and got for reply,—</p>

<p>‘My dear, you will never understand women.’</p>

<p>‘How is it possible,’ I asked, a little nettled by
the implied rebuke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> ‘when no two women are
alike?’</p>

<p>‘No <em>one</em> woman is alike,’ said Lamia, suddenly
emerging from a luxuriance of leaf and flower that
had concealed her from view; and, though
Veronica was there to disprove the universal application
of her aphorism, I think she spoke from the
very depths of her own inner consciousness.</p>

<p>Not even the novelty of the fresh wing, though
we kept returning to it again and again in the
course of that to us memorable evening, could
keep us indoors. Lilac, hawthorn, and laburnum
had of course flowered and faded, and the glory
of the rhododendrons was fast passing away. But
the air was fragrant with the newly-made but yet
uncarted hay; the scent of the elder was wafted from
the lane; the smell of sweet-briar, with its profusion of
little pink rosebuds, was everywhere in the garden;
and we kept stopping ever and again to inhale the
penetrating perfume of the freshly-opened tassels
of the lime. Longer and darker grew the
shadows on the lawn, then gradually drew themselves
in, and vanished. The Tea Roses, no longer
languid from the heat of the long summer day,
lifted their fair faces freshened with evening dew;
the streaks of crimson that point the pathway of
departed days gradually faded from the west, and
the lingering love-song of the missel-thrush at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
length came to end, absorbed into the general
silence. It was twilight still, but a twilight slowly
succumbing to the Midsummer night, if night it
could be called to which the darkness never wholly
came. Elsewhere, on shrub and sward the deepening
dusk brought its beneficent tribute of abounding
moisture; but, under the manifold foliage
of the Oak, the ground retained the dryness of
noon. Under its protecting canopy therefore, as
many a time before, satisfied and silent we sate; till
Lamia, moved by the influence of the hour, once
again liberated her fresh young voice, and wedded
to notes of almost austere simplicity the no less
simple measure of this Vesper Hymn.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
